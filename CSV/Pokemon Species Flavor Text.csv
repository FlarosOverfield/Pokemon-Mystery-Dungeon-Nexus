42,4,9,"However hard its victim's hide may be, it punctureswith sharp fangs and gorges itself with blood."
43,4,9,"Awakened by moon­ light, it roams  actively at night.In the day, it stays quietly underground."
44,4,9,What appears to be drool is actually sweet honey. It isvery sticky and clings stubbornly if touched.
45,4,9,"It has the world's largest petals. With every step,the petals shake out heavy clouds of toxic pollen."
46,4,9,"It is doused with mushroom spores when it is born.As its body grows, mushrooms sprout from its back."
47,4,9,"It stays mostly in dark, damp places, the preference notof the bug, but of the big mush­ rooms on its back."
48,4,9,Its eyes also function as radar units. It catchesand eats small bugs that hide in darkness.
49,4,9,"When it attacks, it flaps its large wings violently toscatter its poi­ sonous powder all around."
50,4,9,"Its skin is very thin. If it is exposed to light,its blood heats up, causing it to grow weak."
51,4,9,"Its three heads bob separately up and down to loosenthe soil nearby, making it easier for it to burrow."
52,4,9,It is fascinated by round objects. It can't stopplaying with them until it tires and falls asleep.
53,4,9,"Many adore it for its sophisticated air. However, itwill lash out and scratch for little reason."
54,4,9,It has mystical powers but doesn't recall that it hasused them. That is why it always looks puzzled.
55,4,9,"When it swims at full speed using its long, webbedlimbs, its fore­ head somehow be­ gins to glow."
56,4,9,It is extremely ill-tempered. Groups of themwill attack any handy target for no reason.
57,4,9,"If approached while asleep, it may awaken andangrily give chase in a groggy state of semi-sleep."
58,4,9,It has a brave and trustworthy na­ ture. It fear­lessly stands up to bigger and stronger foes.
59,4,9,This legendary Chinese POKEMON is considered magnif­icent. Many people are enchanted by its grand mane.
60,4,9,"Because it is in­ ept at walking on its newly grownlegs, it always  swims around in water."
61,4,9,The swirl on its belly subtly un­ dulates. Staringat it may gradual­ ly cause drowsi­ ness.
62,4,9,This strong and skilled swimmer is even capable ofcrossing the Pacific Ocean just by kicking.
63,4,9,It senses impend­ ing attacks and TELEPORTS away tosafety before the actual attacks can strike.
64,4,9,"It possesses strong spiritual power. The moredanger it faces, the stronger its psychic power."
65,4,9,Closing both its eyes heightens all its other senses.This enables it to use its abilities to their extremes.
66,4,9,"Always brimming with power, it passes time bylifting boulders. Doing so makes it even stronger."
67,4,9,"It always goes at its full power, but this verytough and durable POKéMON never gets tired."
68,4,9,It quickly swings its four arms to rock its opponentswith ceaseless punches and chops from all angles.
69,4,9,"Even though its body is extremely skinny, it isblindingly fast when catching its prey."
70,4,9,"Even though it is filled with ACID, it does not meltbecause it also oozes a neutral­ izing fluid."
71,4,9,"ACID that has dis­ solved many prey becomes sweeter,making it even more effective at attracting prey."
72,4,9,"When the tide goes out, dehydrated TENTACOOL remainscan be found washed up on the shore."
73,4,9,Its 80 tentacles absorb water and stretch almostendlessly to CON­ STRICT its prey and enemies.
74,4,9,"Most people may not notice, but a closer lookshould reveal that there are many GEODUDE around."
75,4,9,"With a free and uncaring nature, it doesn't mind ifpieces break off while it rolls down mountains."
76,4,9,It sheds its skin once a year. The discarded shellimmediately hard­ ens and crumbles away.
77,4,9,It is a weak run­ ner immediately after birth. Itgradually becomes faster by chasing after its parents.
78,4,9,"At full gallop, its four hooves barely touch theground because it moves so incredi­ bly fast."
79,4,9,"It lazes vacantly near water. If something bitesits tail, it won't even notice for a whole day."
80,4,9,"If the tail-biting SHELLDER is thrown off in a harshbattle, it reverts to being an ordi­ nary SLOWPOKE."
81,4,9,It is attracted by electromagnetic waves. It mayapproach trainers if they are using their POKéGEAR.
82,4,9,Three MAGNEMITE are linked by a strong magneticforce. Earaches will occur if you get too close.
83,4,9,"If anyone tries to disturb where the essential plantsticks grow, it uses its own stick to thwart them."
84,4,9,"By alternately raising and lower­ ing its two heads,it balances itself to be more stable while running."
85,4,9,"It collects data  and plans three times as wisely,but it may think too much and be­ come immobilized."
86,4,9,"Although it can't walk well on land, it is a gracefulswimmer. It espe­ cially loves being in frigid seas."
87,4,9,"Its streamlined body has little drag in water.The colder the temperature, the friskier it gets."
88,4,9,"As it moves, it loses bits of its body from whichnew GRIMER emerge. This worsens the stench around it."
89,4,9,"They love to gath­ er in smelly areas where sludge ac­cumulates, making the stench around them worse."
90,4,9,It swims facing backward by open­ ing and closingits two-piece shell. It is surprisingly fast.
91,4,9,"Once it slams its shell shut, it is impossible toopen, even by those with superi­ or strength."
92,4,9,"With its gas-like body, it can sneak into any place itdesires. However, it can be blown away by wind."
93,4,9,"In total darkness, where nothing is visible, HAUNTERlurks, silently stalking its next victim."
94,4,9,"It steals heat from its surround­ ings. If you feela sudden chill, it is certain that a GENGAR appeared."
95,4,9,It twists and squirms through the ground. Thethunderous roar of its tunneling echoes a long way.
96,4,9,"If you think that you had a good dream, but youcan't remember it, a DROWZEE has probably eaten it."
97,4,9,"When it is very hungry, it puts humans it meets tosleep, then it feasts on their dreams."
98,4,9,"If it senses dan­ ger approaching, it cloaks itselfwith bubbles from its mouth so it will look bigger."
99,4,9,"It can hardly lift its massive, overgrown pincer.The pincer's size makes it difficult to aim properly."
100,4,9,"It rolls to move. If the ground is uneven, a suddenjolt from hitting a bump can cause it to explode."
101,4,9,"It is dangerous. If it has too much electricity andhas nothing to do, it amuses itself by exploding."
102,4,9,"The shell is very durable. Even if it cracks, it cansurvive without spilling the contents."
103,4,9,"Its three heads think independent­ ly. However, theyare friendly and never appear to squabble."
104,4,9,"If it is sad or lonely, the skull it wears shakes,and emits a plain­ tive and mournful sound."
105,4,9,It has been seen pounding boulders with the bone itcarries in order to tap out mes­ sages to others.
106,4,9,This amazing POKé­ MON has an awesome sense of balance.It can kick in succession from any position.
107,4,9,"Its punches slice the air. However, it seems to need ashort break after fighting for three minutes."
108,4,9,"Its tongue has well-developed nerves that runto the very tip, so it can be deft­ ly manipulated."
109,4,9,"Its thin, filmy body is filled with gases thatcause constant sniffles, coughs and teary eyes."
110,4,9,"If one of the twin KOFFING inflates, the other onedeflates. It con­ stantly mixes its poisonous gases."
111,4,9,It is inept at turning because of its four shortlegs. It can only charge and run in one direction.
112,4,9,"Its rugged hide protects it from even the heat oflava. However, the hide also makes it insensitive."
113,4,9,"It walks carefully to prevent its egg from breaking.However, it is extremely fast at running away."
114,4,9,The vines that cloak its entire body are alwaysjiggling. They effectively un­ nerve its foes.
115,4,9,"If it is safe, the young gets out of the belly pouch toplay. The adult keeps a close eye on the youngster."
116,4,9,"If attacked by a larger enemy, it quickly swims tosafety by adeptly controlling its dorsal fin."
117,4,9,An examination of its cells revealed the presence of agene not found in HORSEA. It became a hot topic.
118,4,9,"Its dorsal, pecto­ ral and tail fins wave elegantly inwater. That is why it is known as the water dancer."
119,4,9,"During spawning season, SEAKING gather from allover, coloring the rivers a brilliant red."
120,4,9,"At night, the cen­ ter of its body slowly flickerswith the same rhythm as a human heartbeat."
121,4,9,The center section of its body is called the core.It glows in a dif­ ferent color each time it is seen.
122,4,9,"A skilled mime from birth, it gains the abilityto create invisi­ ble objects as it matures."
123,4,9,"It slashes through grass with its sharp scythes,moving too fast for the human eye to track."
124,4,9,It rocks its body rhythmically. It appears to alterthe rhythm depend­ ing on how it is feeling.
125,4,9,"Electricity runs across the surface of its body. Indarkness, its en­ tire body glows a whitish-blue."
126,4,9,"It dislikes cold places, so it blows scorchingflames to make the environment suit­ able for itself."
127,4,9,"With its horns, it digs burrows to sleep in at night.In the morning, damp soil clings to its body."
128,4,9,They fight each other by locking horns. The herd'sprotector takes pride in its bat­ tle-scarred horns.
129,4,9,"An underpowered, pathetic POKéMON. It may jump highon rare occasions, but never more than seven feet."
130,4,9,"They say that during past wars, GYARADOS wouldappear and leave blazing ruins in its wake."
131,4,9,"They have gentle hearts. Because they rarely fight,many have been caught. Their num­ ber has dwindled."
132,4,9,"It can transform into anything. When it sleeps, itchanges into a stone to avoid being attacked."
133,4,9,It has the ability to alter the com­ position of itsbody to suit its surrounding envi­ ronment.
134,4,9,"When VAPOREON's fins begin to vi­ brate, it is asign that rain will come within a few hours."
135,4,9,It concentrates the weak electric charges emittedby its cells and launches wicked lightning bolts.
136,4,9,"It stores some of the air it inhales in its internalflame pouch, which heats it to over 3,000 degrees."
137,4,9,"It is a manmade POKéMON. Since it doesn't breathe,people are eager to try it in any environment."
138,4,9,"Revived from an ancient fossil, this POKéMON usesair stored in its shell to sink and rise in water."
139,4,9,"Apparently, it cracked SHELLDER's shell with itssharp fangs and sucked out the insides."
140,4,9,"On rare occasions, some have been found as fossilswhich they became while hiding on the ocean floor."
141,4,9,"In the water, it tucks in its limbs to become morecompact, then it wiggles its shell to swim fast."
142,4,9,"A vicious POKéMON from the distant past, it appearsto have flown by spreading its wings and gliding."
143,4,9,What sounds like its cry may ac­ tually be itssnores or the rumblings of its hungry belly.
144,4,9,"The magnificent, seemingly translu­ cent wings of thislegendary bird POKéMON are said to be made of ice."
145,4,9,This legendary bird POKéMON causes savagethunderstorms by flapping its glit­ tering wings.
146,4,9,This legendary POKéMON scatters embers with everyflap of its wings. It is a thrilling sight to behold.
147,4,9,It is born large to start with. It repeatedly shedsits skin as it steadily grows longer.
148,4,9,"They say that if it emits an aura from its wholebody, the weather will begin to change instantly."
149,4,9,It is said that this POKéMON con­ stantly flies overthe immense seas and rescues drown­ ing people.
150,4,9,"Because its battle abilities were raised to theultimate level, it thinks only of de­ feating its foes."
151,4,9,"Apparently, it appears only to those people whoare pure of heart and have a strong desire to see it."
152,4,9,A sweet aroma gently wafts from the leaf on itshead. It is docile and loves to soak up the sun's rays.
153,4,9,"The scent of spices comes from around its neck.Somehow, sniffing it makes you want to fight."
154,4,9,The aroma that rises from its petals contains asubstance that calms aggressive feelings.
155,4,9,"It is timid, and always curls it­ self up in a ball.If attacked, it flares up its back for protection."
156,4,9,Be careful if it turns its back during battle. Itmeans that it will attack with the fire on its back.
157,4,9,"If its rage peaks, it becomes so hot that anything thattouches it will instantly go up in flames."
158,4,9,Its well-developed jaws are powerful and capable ofcrushing anything. Even its trainer must be careful.
159,4,9,"If it loses a fang, a new one grows back in itsplace. There are always 48 fangs lining its mouth."
160,4,9,"When it bites with its massive and powerful jaws, itshakes its head and savagely tears its victim up."
161,4,9,"A very cautious POKéMON, it raises itself up usingits tail to get a better view of its surroundings."
162,4,9,It makes a nest to suit its long and skinny body. Thenest is impossible for other POKéMON to enter.
163,4,9,"It always stands on one foot. It changes feet sofast, the movement can rarely be seen."
164,4,9,Its eyes are specially adapted. They concentrateeven faint light and enable it to see in the dark.
165,4,9,It is very timid. It will be afraid to move if it isalone. But it will be active if it is in a group.
166,4,9,"When the stars flicker in the night sky, itflutters about, scattering a glowing powder."
167,4,9,"It lies still in the same pose for days in its web,waiting for its unsuspecting prey to wander close."
168,4,9,It spins string not only from its rear but also fromits mouth. It is hard to tell which end is which.
169,4,9,It flies so si­ lently through the dark on its fourwings that it may not be noticed even when nearby.
170,4,9,It shoots positive and negative elec­ tricity betweenthe tips of its two antennae and zaps its enemies.
171,4,9,The light it emits is so bright that it can illuminatethe sea's surface from a depth of over three miles.
172,4,9,It is not yet skilled at storing electricity.It may send out a jolt if amused or startled.
173,4,9,"Because of its unusual, star-like silhouette, peoplebelieve that it came here on a meteor."
174,4,9,"It has a very soft body. If it starts to roll, it willbounce all over and be impossible to stop."
175,4,9,The shell seems to be filled with joy. It is saidthat it will share good luck when treated kindly.
176,4,9,"They say that it will appear before kindhearted, car­ing people and shower them with happiness."
177,4,9,"Because its wings aren't yet fully grown, it has tohop to get around. It is always star­ ing at something."
178,4,9,They say that it stays still and quiet because itis seeing both the past and future at the same time.
179,4,9,"If static elec­ tricity builds in its body, itsfleece doubles in volume. Touching it will shock you."
180,4,9,"As a result of storing too much electricity, itdeveloped patches where even downy wool won't grow."
181,4,9,The tail's tip shines brightly and can be seenfrom far away. It acts as a beacon for lost people.
182,4,9,BELLOSSOM gather at times and appear to dance.They say that the dance is a ritual to summon the sun.
183,4,9,"The tip of its tail, which con­ tains oil that islighter than wa­ ter, lets it swim without drowning."
184,4,9,"By keeping still and listening in­ tently, it cantell what is in even wild, fast- moving rivers."
185,4,9,"Although it always pretends to be a tree, its composi­tion appears to be closer to a rock than a plant."
186,4,9,"If POLIWAG and POLIWHIRL hear its echoing cry, theyrespond by gather­ ing from far and wide."
187,4,9,"To keep from being blown away by the wind, they gatherin clusters. They do enjoy gentle breezes, though."
188,4,9,The bloom on top of its head opens and closes as thetemperature fluc­ tuates up and down.
189,4,9,"Once it catches the wind, it deft­ ly controls itscotton-puff spores to float, even around the world."
190,4,9,Its tail is so powerful that it can use it to graba tree branch and hold itself up in the air.
191,4,9,"It may drop out of the sky suddenly. If attacked by aSPEAROW, it will violently shake its leaves."
192,4,9,"It converts sun­ light into energy. In the darknessafter sunset, it closes its petals and becomes still."
193,4,9,"If it flaps its wings really fast, it can generateshock waves that will shatter win­ dows in the area."
194,4,9,This POKéMON lives in cold water. It will leave thewater to search for food when it gets cold outside.
195,4,9,"This carefree POKéMON has an easy-going nature.While swimming, it always bumps into boat hulls."
196,4,9,It uses the fine hair that covers its body to senseair currents and predict its ene­ my's actions.
197,4,9,"When agitated, this POKéMON pro­ tects itself byspraying poisonous sweat from its pores."
198,4,9,"Feared and loathed by many, it is believed to bringmisfortune to all those who see it at night."
199,4,9,"It has incredible intellect and in­ tuition. Whateverthe situation, it remains calm and collected."
200,4,9,It likes playing mischievous tricks such as screamingand wailing to startle people at night.
201,4,9,Their shapes look like hieroglyphs on ancient tab­lets. It is said that the two are somehow related.
202,4,9,"It hates light and shock. If attack­ ed, it inflatesits body to pump up its counter­ strike."
203,4,9,"Its tail has a small brain of its own. Beware! Ifyou get close, it may react to your scent and bite."
204,4,9,It likes to make its shell thicker by adding layersof tree bark. The additional weight doesn't bother it.
205,4,9,Its entire body is shielded by a steel-hard shell.What lurks inside the armor is a total mystery.
206,4,9,"When spotted, this POKéMON escapes backward by furi­ously boring into the ground with its tail."
207,4,9,It flies straight at its target's face then clampsdown on the star­ tled victim to inject poison.
208,4,9,"Its body has been compressed deep under the ground.As a result, it is even harder than a diamond."
209,4,9,"Although it looks frightening, it is actually kind andaffectionate. It is very popular among women."
210,4,9,"It is actually timid and easily spooked. If at­tacked, it flails about to fend off its attacker."
211,4,9,"To fire its poison spikes, it must inflate its bodyby drinking over 2.6 gallons of water all at once."
212,4,9,It swings its eye- patterned pincers up to scare itsfoes. This makes it look like it has three heads.
213,4,9,The BERRIES it stores in its vase-like shelldecompose and become a gooey liquid.
214,4,9,This powerful POKéMON thrusts its prized hornunder its enemies’ bellies then lifts and throws them.
215,4,9,"Its paws conceal sharp claws. If attacked, it sud­denly extends the claws and startles its enemy."
216,4,9,"If it finds honey, its crescent mark glows. It alwayslicks its paws because they are soaked with honey."
217,4,9,"Although it is a good climber, it prefers to snaptrees with its forelegs and eat fallen BERRIES."
218,4,9,"It never sleeps. It has to keep moving because ifit stopped, its magma body would cool and harden."
219,4,9,The shell on its back is just skin that has cooledand hardened. It breaks easily with a slight touch.
220,4,9,It rubs its snout on the ground to find and dig upfood. It sometimes discovers hot springs.
221,4,9,"Because the long hair all over its body obscures itssight, it just keeps charging repeatedly."
222,4,9,It continuously sheds and grows. The tip of itshead is prized as a treasure for its beauty.
223,4,9,It has superb ac­ curacy. The water it shoots out canstrike even moving prey from more than 300 feet.
224,4,9,It traps enemies with its suction- cupped tentaclesthen smashes them with its rock-hard head.
225,4,9,It carries food all day long. There are talesabout lost people who were saved by the food it had.
226,4,9,"As it majestically swims, it doesn't care if REMORAIDattach to it for scavenging its leftovers."
227,4,9,"Its sturdy wings look heavy, but they are actuallyhollow and light, allowing it to fly freely in the sky."
228,4,9,It uses different kinds of cries for communicating withothers of its kind and for pursuing its prey.
229,4,9,"If you are burned by the flames it shoots from itsmouth, the pain will never go away."
230,4,9,It is said that it usually hides in underwater caves.It can create whirlpools by yawning.
231,4,9,"It swings its long snout around play­ fully, but becauseit is so strong, that can be dan­ gerous."
232,4,9,"It has sharp, hard tusks and a rugged hide. Its TACKLEis strong enough to knock down a house."
233,4,9,"This upgraded version of PORYGON is designed forspace exploration. It can't fly, though."
234,4,9,The curved antlers subtly change the flow of air tocreate a strange space where real­ ity is distorted.
235,4,9,A special fluid oozes from the tip of its tail. Itpaints the fluid everywhere to mark its territory.
236,4,9,"It is always bursting with en­ ergy. To make it­self stronger, it keeps on fighting even if it loses."
237,4,9,"If you become enchanted by its smooth, elegant,dance-like kicks, you may get drilled hard."
238,4,9,Its lips are the most sensitive parts on its body.It always uses its lips first to examine things.
239,4,9,"It rotates its arms to generate electricity, butit tires easily, so it charges up only a little bit."
240,4,9,"Each and every time it inhales and exhales, hotembers dribble out of its mouth and nostrils."
241,4,9,"Its milk is packed with nutrition, making it theultimate beverage for the sick or weary."
242,4,9,Anyone who takes even one bite of BLISSEY's egg be­comes unfailingly caring and pleas­ ant to everyone.
243,4,9,The rain clouds it carries let it fire thunderboltsat will. They say that it descended with lightning.
244,4,9,"Volcanoes erupt when it barks. Un­ able to restrainits extreme power, it races headlong around the land."
245,4,9,"Said to be the reincarnation of north winds, itcan instantly purify filthy, murky water."
246,4,9,"It feeds on soil. After it has eaten a large mountain,it will fall asleep so it can grow."
247,4,9,"Its shell is as hard as sheet rock, and it isalso very strong. Its THRASHING can topple a mountain."
248,4,9,"Its body can't be harmed by any sort of attack, so itis very eager to make challenges against enemies."
249,4,9,It is said that it quietly spends its time deep at thebottom of the sea because its powers are too strong.
250,4,9,Legends claim this POKéMON flies the world's skies con­tinuously on its magnificent seven- colored wings.
251,4,9,This POKéMON wan­ ders across time. Grass and treesflourish in the forests in which it has appeared.
1,5,9,"It carries a seed on its back right from birth. As itgrows older, the seed also grows larger."
2,5,9,"If the bud on its back starts to smell sweet, itis evidence that the large flower will soon bloom."
3,5,9,"It is able to con­ vert sunlight into energy. As aresult, it is more powerful in the summertime."
4,5,9,"The flame on its tail indicates CHARMANDER's lifeforce. If it is healthy, the flame burns brightly."
5,5,9,"It has a barbaric nature. In battle, it whips itsfiery tail around and slashes away with sharp claws."
6,5,9,"Breathing intense, hot flames, it can melt almost any­thing. Its breath inflicts terrible pain on enemies."
7,5,9,"The shell, which hardens soon after it is born, isresilient. If you poke it, it will bounce back out."
8,5,9,It cleverly con­ trols its furry ears and tail tomaintain its balance while swimming.
9,5,9,The rocket cannons on its shell fire jets of watercapable of punch­ ing holes through thick steel.
10,5,9,Its feet have suction cups designed to stickto any surface. It tenaciously climbs trees to forage.
11,5,9,It prepares for evolution by har­ dening its shellas much as possi­ ble to protect its soft body.
12,5,9,"Water-repellent powder on its wings enables itto collect honey, even in the heav­ iest of rains."
13,5,9,It attacks using a two-inch poison barb on its head.It can usually be found under the leaves it eats.
14,5,9,"From this form, it will grow into an adult. As itsbody becomes soft­ er, the external shell hardens."
15,5,9,It has three poison barbs. The barb on itstail secretes the most powerful poison.
16,5,9,"Common in grassy areas and forests, it is very docileand will chase off enemies by flap­ ping up sand."
17,5,9,"It immobilizes its prey using well- developed claws,then carries the prey more than 60 miles to its nest."
18,5,9,It spreads its beautiful wings wide to frightenits enemies. It can fly at Mach 2 speed.
19,5,9,"Living wherever there is food available, itceaselessly scav­ enges for edibles the entire day."

21,5,9,"Very protective of its territory, it flaps its shortwings busily to dart around at high speed."
22,5,9,"It cleverly uses its thin, long beak to pluck andeat small insects that hide under the ground."
23,5,9,"It always hides in grass. When first born, it has nopoison, so its bite is painful, but harmless."
24,5,9,"With a very venge­ ful nature, it won't give up thechase, no matter how far, once it targets its prey."
25,5,9,It raises its tail to check its sur­ roundings. Thetail is sometimes struck by light­ ning in this pose.

40,28,9,"As it inhales, it expands...and expands...and expands. Wigglytuff compete to see which one can inflate itself the most."
41,28,9,"When exposed to sunlight, they suffer burns. The frequency of their ultrasonic waves can differ slightly from colony to colony."
42,28,9,"Sometimes they drink so much blood, they can’t fly anymore. Then they fall to the ground and become food for other Pokémon."
46,28,9,Mushrooms called tochukaso sprout from its back. They can be dried and powdered to make a medicine used to extend life.
47,28,9,"It scatters toxic spores from its mushroom cap. Once harvested, these spores can be steeped and boiled down to prepare herbal medicines."
50,28,9,Many farmers cherish and nurture Diglett because its droppings enrich the soil it lives in.
51,28,9,"Despite the closeness between this Pokémon and farmers and other people, no one has ever seen the parts of it concealed underground."
52,28,9,It loves shiny things. It often fights with Murkrow over prey they’re both trying to catch.
53,28,9,"It has a high opinion of itself, although not to the same extent as the Alolan Persian. It’s quite difficult to make friends with this Pokémon."
54,28,9,"This Pokémon is troubled by constant headaches. The more pain it’s in, the more powerful its psychokinesis becomes."
55,28,9,It swims along the banks of lakes and catches fish Pokémon. It takes them to the shore and quietly eats them up.
56,28,9,"Its raging tires it out and causes it to fall asleep, but the anger resonating in its dreams causes it to wake up—which infuriates it all over again."
57,28,9,Some researchers theorize that Primeape remains angry even when inside a Poké Ball.
58,28,9,"It looks cute, but when you approach another Trainer’s Growlithe, it will bark at you and bite."
59,28,9,The fire burning inside its body serves as the energy to fuel it as it runs great distances. It appears in many legends.
60,28,9,It’s still not very good at walking. Its Trainers should train this Pokémon to walk every day.
61,28,9,It marches over the land in search of bug Pokémon to eat. Then it takes them underwater so it can dine on them where it’s safe.
62,28,9,"Its percentage of body fat is nearly zero. Its body is entirely muscle, which makes it heavy and forces its swimming prowess to develop."
63,28,9,"It can teleport itself to safety while it’s asleep, but when it wakes, it doesn’t know where it is, so it panics."
64,28,9,Kadabra’s presence infests televisions and monitors with creepy shadows that bring bad luck.
65,28,9,"Its brain cells continue to increase in number until its death. The older the Alakazam, the larger its head."
66,28,9,"With its superhuman strength, it’s able to throw a hundred people all at the same time. Its strength comes from lifting Graveler every day."
67,28,9,It willingly assists with hard labor because it knows the work is good training for its muscles.
68,28,9,It can lift heavy loads with the greatest of ease. It can even heft dump trucks. But its clumsy fingers prevent it from doing any precision work.
72,28,9,"It drifts in shallow seas, such as the areas near beaches. If you get bitten or stabbed by its toxic tentacles, rush to the hospital."
73,28,9,"Although these Pokémon are rare, when a large outbreak of them occurs, all fish Pokémon disappear from the surrounding sea."
74,28,9,There are plenty of them to be found along any road. A scholar with too much free time once counted a hundred of them along a single route.
75,28,9,"This slow-footed Pokémon moves by curling up and rolling instead of walking. With enough momentum, its speed can exceed 60 mph."
76,28,9,"Once a year, this Pokémon molts, and its shed shell returns to the soil. This process creates enriched soil, so farmers collect the shells."
79,28,9,Alolan home cooking involves drying Slowpoke tails and then simmering them into a salty stew.
80,28,9,"Whenever Shellder bites down hard on its tail, it gives Slowbro a flash of inspiration...which it forgets a moment later."
81,28,9,"It sends out electromagnetic waves, which let it float through the air. Touching it while it’s eating electricity will give you a full-body shock."
82,28,9,"It has about three times the electrical power of Magnemite. For some reason, outbreaks of this Pokémon happen when lots of sunspots appear."
88,28,9,"It was born from sludge transformed by exposure to X-rays from the moon. When its internal load of germs decreases, it dies."
89,28,9,"After recent environmental improvements, this Pokémon is now hardly seen at all. People speculate that it may go extinct at some point."
90,28,9,This Pokémon’s tongue is always hanging out. It uses its tongue with great dexterity to dig up sand from the seabed in its search for food.
91,28,9,Excavation of the tombs of ancient hunting tribes has turned up many spears tipped with spikes that had fallen off this Pokémon’s shell.
92,28,9,"Although Gastly is barely visible, when it’s near, a faint sweet smell lingers."
93,28,9,It fears the light and revels in the dark. It may be on the verge of extinction in cities that stay brightly lit at night.
94,28,9,"It apparently wishes for a traveling companion. Since it was once human itself, it tries to create one by taking the lives of other humans."
96,28,9,"It finds really fun dreams tasty. When it makes friends with people, it may show them the most delicious dreams it’s ever eaten."
97,28,9,"As a matter of course, it makes anyone it meets fall asleep and has a taste of their dreams. Anyone having a good dream, it carries off."
102,28,9,"Six of them together form a full-fledged Pokémon. It’s often hunted by Crabrawler, but uses psychokinesis to drive it off."
103,28,9,"When the time comes, one of its three heads falls off. Before long, the fallen head grows into an Exeggcute."
104,28,9,"The skull it wears on its head is that of its dead mother. According to some, it will evolve when it comes to terms with the pain of her death."
105,28,9,"This Pokémon is out for vengeance on its natural enemy, Mandibuzz. It throws bones like boomerangs to try to take it down."
113,28,9,"Not only are these Pokémon fast runners, they’re also few in number, so anyone who finds one must be lucky indeed."
115,28,9,The child in its pouch leaves home after roughly three years. That is the only time the mother is heard to cry wildly.
118,28,9,"Spellbound by the length of its horn and the beauty of its fins, many strange Trainers raise Goldeen and nothing but Goldeen."
119,28,9,Trainers who are crazy for Seaking are divided into horn enthusiasts and fin enthusiasts. The two groups do not get along well.
120,28,9,"This Pokémon gets nibbled on by Lumineon and others. Thanks to its red core, it regenerates fast, so it’s unconcerned by their snack attacks."
121,28,9,"Its unusual body shape, reminiscent of abstract art, led local people to spread rumors that this Pokémon may be an invader from outer space."
123,28,9,"While young, they live together deep in the mountains, training themselves in how to fight with their scythes and move at high speeds."
125,28,9,Electricity leaks from it in amounts far greater than the amount of electricity it eats.
126,28,9,"When angered, it spouts brilliant fire from all over its body. It doesn’t calm down until its opponent has burned to ash."
127,28,9,One solid blow from its horns is enough to split apart a large tree. Its greatest rival in Alola is Vikavolt.
128,28,9,"Although it’s known to be a fierce Pokémon, Tauros in the Alola region are said to possess a measure of calmness."
129,28,9,"Its reckless leaps make it easy pickings for predators. On the bright side, many Pokémon enjoy longer life spans, thanks to Magikarp."
130,28,9,There are people who swear that any place Gyarados appears is fated for destruction.
131,28,9,"These Pokémon were once near extinction due to poaching. Following protective regulations, there is now an overabundance of them."
132,28,9,"With its astonishing capacity for metamorphosis, it can get along with anything. It does not get along well with its fellow Ditto."
133,28,9,Current studies show it can evolve into an incredible eight different species of Pokémon.
134,28,9,"Blending in with the water and erasing all signs of its presence, it patiently waits for its prey, fish Pokémon."
135,28,9,"When its fur stands on end, that’s a sign it’s about to give off a jolt of electricity. Take care, as sometimes lightning strikes next to it, too."
136,28,9,"Its average body temperature is between 1,300 and 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. In its internal flame sac, temperatures reach 3,000 degrees."
137,28,9,"It can convert its body into digital data, which enables it to enter cyberspace."
142,28,9,"In ancient times, it ruled the skies. A widely accepted theory is that it went extinct due to a large meteor impact."
143,28,9,It eats nearly 900 pounds of food every day. It starts nodding off while eating—and continues to eat even while it’s asleep.
147,28,9,"After a 10-hour struggle, a fisherman was able to pull one up and confirm its existence."
148,28,9,"From time immemorial, it has been venerated by agricultural peoples as an entity able to control the weather."
149,28,9,"Incur the wrath of this normally calm Pokémon at your peril, because it will smash everything to smithereens before it’s satisfied."
165,28,9,"They communicate with one another using bodily fluids that give off odors. When they’re angry, their odor smells sour."
166,28,9,"In battle, it throws punches with all four arms. The power of each individual blow is piddly, so it aims to win by quantity rather than quality."
167,28,9,Some fishermen weave its sturdy thread into nets to catch fish Pokémon.
168,28,9,It spins thread from both its rear and its mouth. Then it wraps its prey up in thread and sips their bodily fluids at its leisure.
169,28,9,"Silent and swift in its four-winged flight, it bites down on its prey before they realize what’s happening. In a heartbeat, it drains their blood."
170,28,9,It lives in the depths beyond the reach of sunlight. It flashes lights on its antennae to communicate with others of its kind.
171,28,9,This Pokémon flashes a bright light that blinds its prey. This creates an opening for it to deliver an electrical attack.
172,28,9,"Despite this Pokémon’s cute appearance, those who want to live with one should prepare to be on the receiving end of its electric jolts."
173,28,9,"Because of its silhouette, it’s believed to be a star reborn. For some reason, it loves Minior."
174,28,9,"It moves by bouncing along. As it moves a lot, it sweats, and its body gives off a sweet aroma."
185,28,9,"Apparently, the larger the green parts of this Pokémon, the more collectors value it. It’s a particular favorite among elderly people."
186,28,9,"It’s the leader of Poliwag and Poliwhirl. When Politoed roars, they all cower in fear."
196,28,9,"It unleashes psychic power from the orb on its forehead. When its power is exhausted, the orb grows dull and dark."
197,28,9,"With its black fur, it blends into the darkness. It bides its time, and when prey appears, this Pokémon goes for its throat, and then eats it."
198,28,9,"Seen as a symbol of bad luck, it’s generally disliked. Yet it gives presents—objects that sparkle or shine—to Trainers it’s close to."
199,28,9,"This Pokémon is so famed for its intellect that a proverb still persists in some regions: “When in doubt, ask Slowking.”"
200,28,9,"If you hear a sobbing sound emanating from a vacant room, it’s undoubtedly a bit of mischief from Misdreavus."
209,28,9,Its growls make its opponents uneasy. This laid-back Pokémon tends to sleep half the day.
210,28,9,"More timid than Snubbull, this Pokémon is doted on by young people amused at the contrast between its looks and its attitude."
212,28,9,"Once it has identified an enemy, this Pokémon smashes it mercilessly with pincers hard as steel."
215,28,9,It uses its claws to poke holes in eggs so it can slurp out the insides. Breeders consider it a scourge and will drive it away or eradicate it.
222,28,9,"Pursued by Mareanie for the branches on its head, this Pokémon will sometimes snap its own branches off as a diversion while it escapes."
225,28,9,"It has a generous habit of sharing its food with people and Pokémon, so it’s always scrounging around for more food."
227,28,9,"Its metal body is sturdy, but it does rust rather easily. So on rainy days, this Pokémon prefers to stay put in its nest."
233,28,9,Porygon was updated to a new version in readiness for planetary development. But that dream remains unrealized as yet.
235,28,9,"It draws symbols all over the place to mark its territory. In towns with many Smeargle, the walls are covered in graffiti."
239,28,9,This Pokémon is constantly fighting with Togedemaru that try to steal its electricity. It’s a pretty even match.
240,28,9,A famous potter lives with a Magby. Apparently its soft flames produce fine works.
241,28,9,"Most people raise it for its milk, but it’s quite tough and strong, so it’s also well suited for battle."
242,28,9,"Its fluffy fur coat acts as a sensor, enabling it to read the feelings of people and Pokémon."
278,28,9,"Fishermen keep an eye out for Wingull in the sky, because wherever they’re circling, the ocean is sure to be teeming with fish Pokémon."
279,28,9,Gathering food is the work of young males. They store food in their capacious beaks and carry it back to others waiting in the nest.
283,28,9,"When this Pokémon senses danger, a sweet fluid oozes from the tip of its head. The taste of it disgusts bird Pokémon."
284,28,9,"Its wings and antennae don’t cope well with moisture. After a rain, it faces sunward to dry off."
296,28,9,"Their daily routine consists of training together first thing in the morning, eating and napping in the afternoon, and then more training afterward."
297,28,9,They love to compare their freakish strength— strength enough to send a truck flying with a single slap.
299,28,9,"It uses powerful magnetism to drag its prey toward it. It’s also been known to pull in metal, which it collects and uses to protect itself."
302,28,9,"This Pokémon is feared. When its gemstone eyes begin to glow with a sinister shine, it’s believed that Sableye will steal people’s spirits away."
318,28,9,"If they scent the faintest trace of blood, they rush to attack en masse. When alone, they’re rather cowardly."
319,28,9,"It has a sad history. In the past, its dorsal fin was a treasured foodstuff, so this Pokémon became a victim of overfishing."
320,28,9,It shows off by spraying jets of seawater from the nostrils above its eyes. It eats a solid ton of Wishiwashi every day.
321,28,9,Its immense size is the reason for its popularity. Wailord watching is a favorite sightseeing activity in various parts of the world.
324,28,9,"If the fire burning within its shell goes out, it will die. Those who wish to raise one in their home must always keep something flammable at hand."
327,28,9,Each and every Spinda has a slightly different configuration of spots. There are collectors who enjoy the tiny differences in their spot patterns.
328,28,9,"As it digs through the sand, its giant jaws crush any rocks that obstruct its path. It builds a funnel-shaped nest."
329,28,9,"To help make its wings grow, it dissolves quantities of prey in its digestive juices and guzzles them down every day."
330,28,9,This Pokémon hides in the heart of sandstorms it creates and seldom appears where people can see it.
339,28,9,"Its slippery body is hard to grasp, so much so that there are festivals where people compete to see how many they can catch barehanded."
340,28,9,Sighting Whiscash leaping from the water is believed to herald an earthquake.
349,28,9,"Although unattractive and unpopular, this Pokémon’s marvelous vitality has made it a subject of research."
350,28,9,"It lives at the bottom of clear lakes. In times of war, it shows itself, which soothes people’s minds and hearts."
351,28,9,"Its form changes on its own, due to its cells’ sensitive reactions to temperature and humidity."
359,28,9,"Although it’s said to bring disaster, in actuality, this Pokémon possesses a calm disposition and warns people of any crises that loom."
361,28,9,"It can only survive in cold areas. It bounces happily around, even in environments as cold as -150 degrees Fahrenheit."
362,28,9,"Its prey is instantaneously frozen stiff by the cold air it exhales from its huge mouth. While they’re in that frozen state, it gobbles them up."
369,28,9,"It was fortuitously discovered during a deep sea expedition. Its teeth have atrophied, so it now survives on microscopic organisms it sucks up."
370,28,9,"Loving couples have a soft spot for this Pokémon, so honeymoon hotels often release this Pokémon into their pools."
371,28,9,"With its steel-hard stone head, it headbutts indiscriminately. This is because of the stress it feels at being unable to fly."
372,28,9,"They lurk deep within caves—motionless, neither eating nor drinking. Why they don’t die is not known."
373,28,9,"It flies around on its wings, which have grown in at last. In its happiness, it gushes hot flames, burning up the fields it passes over."
374,28,9,"With magnetic traction, it pulls its opponents in close. When they’re in range, it slashes them with its rear claws."
375,28,9,"It adores magnetic minerals, so it pursues Nosepass at speeds exceeding 60 mph."
376,28,9,"A linkage of two Metang, this Pokémon can perform any calculation in a flash by utilizing parallel processing in its four brains."
408,28,9,"In rock layers where Cranidos fossils are found, the fossilized trunks of trees snapped in two are also often found."
409,28,9,Records exist of a revived fossil that evolved into Rampardos. It proceeded to escape and then destroy a skyscraper with a headbutt.
410,28,9,"This Pokémon lived in primeval jungles. Few enemies would have been willing to square off against its heavily armored face, so it’s thought."
411,28,9,It lived in the same environments as Rampardos. Their fossils have been found together— seemingly from after they’d fought to the finish.
422,28,9,"Purple mucus sticks to the hands of anyone who touches it. Take care, as the substance is troublesome to wash off."
423,28,9,"Plankton, invisible to the naked eye, is its main food source. It comes onto the land periodically, but the reason for this is not known."
425,28,9,"If for some reason its body bursts, its soul spills out with a screaming sound."
426,28,9,"Even while under careful observation, large flocks of Drifblim flying at dusk will inexplicably disappear from view."
429,28,9,"Mismagius have been known to cast spells to make people fall in love, so some people search for this Pokémon as if their life depended on it."
430,28,9,"If its Murkrow cronies fail to catch food for it, or if it feels they have betrayed it, it will hunt them down wherever they are and punish them."
438,28,9,"From its eyes, it can expel excess moisture from its body. This liquid is similar in composition to human sweat."
440,28,9,"It’s too small to lay eggs yet. As a surrogate, it searches out round white stones."
443,28,9,"It skulks in caves, and when prey or an enemy passes by, it leaps out and chomps them. The force of its attack sometimes chips its teeth."
444,28,9,"Shiny objects are its passion. It can be found in its cave, scarcely moving, its gaze fixed on the jewels it’s amassed or Carbink it has caught."
445,28,9,The protuberances on its head serve as sensors. It can even detect distant prey.
446,28,9,"When it finds something that looks like it might be edible, it goes right ahead and swallows it whole. That’s why it gets fatter day by day."
447,28,9,"It’s tough enough to run right through the night, and it’s also a hard worker, but it’s still just a youngster."
448,28,9,They can detect the species of a living being— and its emotions—from over half a mile away. They control auras and hunt their prey in packs.
456,28,9,"Its double tail fins propel its energetic jumps. When it breaks the surface of the sea, Wingull swoop down to grab it on the fly."
457,28,9,This deep-sea Pokémon lives at the bottom of the sea. Its fins haul it over the seabed in search of its favorite food—Starmie.

467,28,9,"From its arm, it launches fireballs hotter than 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Its arm starts to melt when it fires a whole barrage."
470,28,9,"The younger they are, the more they smell like fresh grass. With age, their fragrance takes on the odor of fallen leaves."
471,28,9,"It freezes its fur into icicles, spiky and sharp, and tackles its prey."
474,28,9,"Its program was modified to facilitate extra-dimensional activities, but that led to noticeably strange behavior."
476,28,9,"The main body controls three mobile units called Mini-Noses, which it maneuvers to catch prey."
478,28,9,"The soul of a woman lost on a snowy mountain possessed an icicle, becoming this Pokémon. The food it most relishes is the souls of men."
506,28,9,"The long fur surrounding its face functions as radar, enabling it to probe the condition of its battle opponents."
507,28,9,"This Pokémon obeys its master’s orders faithfully. However, it refuses to listen to anything said by a person it doesn’t respect."
508,28,9,"With this wise Pokémon, there could be no concern that it would ever attack people. Some parents even trust it to babysit."
524,28,9,"The hexagonal cavity is its ear. It walks in the direction of sounds it hears, but if the sounds cease, it panics and topples over."
525,28,9,"It explores caves in search of underground water. It’s not comfortable around water, so this Pokémon takes great care in lapping it up."
526,28,9,"Known for its hefty horsepower, this Pokémon is a popular partner for construction workers."
546,28,9,"Pillows and beds stuffed with cotton exhaled by Cottonee are soft and puffy, light and airy— altogether top quality."

548,28,9,"By pruning the leaves on its head with regularity, this Pokémon can be grown into a fine plump shape."
549,28,9,"As soon as it finds a male to be its partner, the beautiful flower on its head darkens, droops, and withers away."
551,28,9,It conceals itself in the sand and chomps down on the legs of any prey that unwarily walk over it. Its favorite food is Trapinch.
552,28,9,"Thanks to the special membrane covering its eyes, it can see its surroundings clearly, even in the middle of the night."
553,28,9,"After clamping down with its powerful jaws, it twists its body around to rip its prey in half."
564,28,9,"Reputed to be the ancestor of most turtle Pokémon, it lived in warm seas approximately a hundred million years ago."
565,28,9,"Active both on land and in the sea, this Pokémon drags its land-based prey into the water to finish it off."
566,28,9,"To all appearances flightless, it was able to glide down from tall treetops to snag its prey."
567,28,9,"They hunted in flocks. When one Archeops had the prey cornered, another would swoop on it."
568,28,9,It gorges on trash until its stomach is full. Then it belches toxic gas. An unlucky whiff of gas will put a person in the hospital.
569,28,9,"For a time, their numbers increased explosively in Alola. Since the arrival of Grimer, their population has decreased dramatically."
582,28,9,It feels pleasantly cool when embraced. This Pokémon is treasured by households in warm regions.
583,28,9,"This Pokémon has existed since the Ice Age. It controls particles of ice, freezes its opponents, and then shatters them with a headbutt."
584,28,9,"Even if it loses one of its heads, it can live relatively problem-free. It makes snow clouds inside its body."
587,28,9,It grills berries and bug Pokémon with electric shocks and makes a meal of them. It usually nests in the holes gouged in trees by Pikipek.
594,28,9,They float upon the open sea. Many water Pokémon gather in the area around Alomomola.
627,28,9,"With its sharp claws, this Pokémon pierces its prey, and then it pecks at them. Although it also consumes berries, it’s a carnivore at heart."
628,28,9,"It’s thought that people disturbed their habitats in the past, so Braviary banded together to fight back."
629,28,9,"It can’t fly yet and must wait until its wings have developed more. Since it’s still at a playful age, it hops around friskily."
630,28,9,"It circles in the sky, keeping a keen eye out for Pokémon in a weakened state. Its choicest food is Cubone."
661,28,9,"When it’s excited, its temperature can double, spiking hormone production in its body."

703,28,9,"Although this Pokémon is not especially rare, its glittering, jewel-draped body draws attention from people."
704,28,9,"Its source of protection is its slimy, germ-laden mucous membrane. Anyone who touches it needs some thorough hand-washing."

706,28,9,"It gets picked on because it’s meek. But then, whoever teased it gets to feel the full force of its horns and a good swatting from its thick tail."

708,28,9,"According to legend, medicine to cure any illness can be made by plucking the green leaves on its head, brewing them, and boiling down the liquid."
709,28,9,"Through its roots, it exerts control over other trees. A deadly curse falls upon anyone cutting down trees in forests where Trevenant dwell."
718,28,9,It’s thought to be monitoring the ecosystem. There are rumors that even greater power lies hidden within it.
722,28,9,"Silently it glides, drawing near its targets. Before they even notice it, it begins to pelt them with vicious kicks."

724,28,9,"Although basically cool and cautious, when it’s caught by surprise, it’s seized by panic."

238,29,9,"When it examines things, before touching them with its hands, it makes lip contact and then diligently licks all the dirt off its lips."
239,29,9,"When it hears the crash of thunder, Elekid’s mood improves. It can be useful to record that sound and play it when Elekid’s feeling down."
240,29,9,"When flames drip from its nose, that means it has a cold. Have it lie down for a nice rest in some magma."
241,29,9,"It produces over five gallons of milk a day. The higher the quality of the pastures it lives in, the richer and tastier its milk becomes."
242,29,9,Their eggs are such a delicacy that some say eating one will bring you happiness. These eggs fetch the highest prices on the market.
246,29,9,"Born underground, it eats its way through dirt to the surface, where its parents are. It doesn’t deal well with the bright light it finds there."
247,29,9,"This troublesome Pokémon can’t wait to evolve, so it relieves its stress by wildly propelling itself around using compressed gas."
248,29,9,"It wanders through the mountains seeking opponents to fight. If it finds an opponent that’s not worthy, Tyranitar ignores it and wanders on."
278,29,9,"With its long, thin wings, it catches updrafts and flies like a glider high up into the sky."
279,29,9,It places small Pokémon into its spacious beak and carries them around. No one knows where it’s taking them.
283,29,9,"If it’s in a pinch, it will secrete a sweet liquid from the tip of its head. Syrup made from gathering that liquid is tasty on bread."
284,29,9,"Masquerain intimidates enemies with the eyelike patterns of its eyespots. If that doesn’t work, it deftly makes its escape on its set of four wings."
296,29,9,It practices its slaps by repeatedly slapping tree trunks. It has been known to slap an Exeggutor and get flung away.
297,29,9,"Although they enjoy comparing their strength, they’re also kind. They value etiquette, praising opponents they battle."
299,29,9,"It moves less than an inch a year, but when it’s in a jam, it will spin and drill down into the ground in a split second."
302,29,9,It digs through the ground with its hard claws and crunches down gems with its thick pointy teeth. Carbink is its favorite food.
303,29,9,"A cunning and terrifying Pokémon, its cuteness makes opponents let down their guard—and then it swallows them whole with its huge jaws."
309,29,9,"Friction between the air and its fur produces static electricity. When Electrike runs, it makes a crackling sound."
310,29,9,Manectric can be found beneath unnatural thunderclouds. People say it can run at the same speed as lightning striking.
318,29,9,"They’re such cowards that they won’t hunt alone. When five or so of them get together, they suddenly turn ferocious!"
319,29,9,"People believe that carrying one of its discarded fangs will prevent mishaps at sea, so the fangs are made into accessories."
320,29,9,It swims along with its mouth open and swallows down seawater along with its food. It sprays excess water out of its nostrils.
321,29,9,"They eat so many fish Pokémon that when Wailord become too numerous, fishermen have to chase them off."
324,29,9,You can tell how it’s feeling by the smoke spouting from its shell. Tremendous velocity is a sign of good health.
327,29,9,Its steps are shaky and stumbling. Walking for a long time makes it feel sick.
328,29,9,Its jaws are strong enough to crush rocks but so heavy that it can’t get up if it flips over. Sandile seize those moments as their chance.
329,29,9,"It vibrates its wings to generate ultrasonic waves, causing its prey to faint. Then it buries the prey alive in the sand to preserve it."
330,29,9,"By flapping their wings, Flygon cause sandstorms that conceal Krookodile. The team then splits the prey they catch."
339,29,9,"Its entire body is gooey. When pecked at by bird Pokémon, it slips and slides its way to freedom."
340,29,9,Whiscash shakes the ground at high intensities to intimidate its opponents. It swallows its prey whole—along with mud from the swamp floor.
341,29,9,"Individuals that have been set free by Trainers who could no longer raise them have become common, and they can now be found in Alola."
342,29,9,"Its temperament is rough and it loves to fight, but as soon as its pincers break off, it turns cowardly. It stays timid until they grow back."
343,29,9,Depictions of Pokémon similar to Baltoy have been found on the walls of caves where primitive humans lived.
344,29,9,"If it gets wet, its body melts. When rain starts to fall, it wraps its whole body up with its psychic powers to protect itself."
345,29,9,"In ancient times, it lived in warm seas. It disguised itself as seaweed to ambush its prey and devoured them whole when they got close."
346,29,9,"Normally, it lived on shallow sea shoals. When the tide went out, this Pokémon came up on land to search for prey."
347,29,9,"When restored Anorith are released into the ocean, they don’t thrive, because the water composition has changed since their era."
348,29,9,It lived on land and went out into the sea to hunt for prey. Its sharp claws were its greatest weapon.
349,29,9,"They look ragged, so no one catches them. They look like they’d taste bad, so predators won’t eat them. And their numbers continue to grow."
350,29,9,"While Milotic is said to be the most beautiful Pokémon, Trainers who like Feebas and have raised it are seemingly disappointed by Milotic."
351,29,9,"Although its form changes with the weather, that is apparently the result of a chemical reaction and not the result of its own free will."
352,29,9,"It changes its hue to blend into its surroundings. If no one takes notice of it for too long, it will pout and never reveal itself."
353,29,9,"It eats up emotions like malice, jealousy, and resentment, so some people are grateful for its presence."
354,29,9,"It’s a stuffed toy that was thrown away and became possessed, ever searching for the one who threw it away so it can exact its revenge."
357,29,9,The bunches of fruit growing around the necks of Tropius in Alola are especially sweet compared to those in other regions.
359,29,9,"The only thing unlucky about Absol is its appearance. It protects fields and warns people of disaster, so one ought to be grateful for it."
361,29,9,It feeds mainly on ice and snow. It’s only able to survive in a limited number of places in the warm Alola region.
362,29,9,"It freezes its prey and chews them whole. However, it prefers to eat Pokémon like Vanillite that are already frozen."
366,29,9,"Despite its appearance, it’s carnivorous. It clamps down on its prey with both sides of its shell and doesn’t let go until they stop moving."
367,29,9,It’s not the strongest swimmer. It wags its tail to lure in its prey and then gulps them down as soon as they get close.
368,29,9,The color of its body changes with the water temperature. The coloration of Gorebyss in Alola is almost blindingly vivid.
369,29,9,"Thought to have gone extinct, Relicanth was given a name that is a variation of the name of the person who discovered it."
370,29,9,There was an era when it was overfished due to the rumor that having one of its heart-shaped scales would enable you to find a sweetheart.
371,29,9,"Whenever it sees bird Pokémon flying through the sky, it becomes envious and smashes its surroundings to bits with headbutts."
372,29,9,The cells within its body are changing at a bewildering pace. Its hard shell is made from the same substance as bone.
373,29,9,"Overjoyed at finally being able to fly, it flies all over the place and usually doesn’t land until it’s completely exhausted and needs to sleep."
374,29,9,"Instead of blood, magnetism flows through its body. When it’s feeling bad, try giving it a magnet."
375,29,9,"With its two brains, it fires powerful psychic energy to stop its prey in their tracks."
376,29,9,It boasts not only psychic powers but also fantastic strength. It grabs its prey with its four legs and holds them in place with its claws.
408,29,9,"A primeval Pokémon, it possesses a hard and sturdy skull, lacking any intelligence within."
409,29,9,"In ancient times, people would dig up fossils of this Pokémon and use its skull, which is harder than steel, to make helmets."
410,29,9,"A mild-mannered, herbivorous Pokémon, it used its face to dig up tree roots to eat. The skin on its face was plenty tough."
411,29,9,"The bones of its face are huge and hard, so they were mistaken for its spine until after this Pokémon was successfully restored."
422,29,9,"While they normally live in the sea, they can function on land, too, until their skin dries out."
423,29,9,"Long ago, it had a shell on its back. There’s now a vestigial plate on its back that’s hard but thin."
424,29,9,"In their search for comfortable trees, they get into territorial disputes with groups of Passimian. They win about half the time."
425,29,9,Its round body is stuffed with souls and expands each time it leads someone away.
426,29,9,"There’s a rumor that if you catch a Drifblim floating on the wind at dusk, you’ll be carried away to the afterlife."
427,29,9,"Its arms and legs are weak, but when it rolls its ears up tight and then unleashes them with its full force, it can smash boulders to dust."
428,29,9,Lopunny regrows its coat twice a year. Mufflers and hats made from its fur are really warm.
429,29,9,"Feared for its wrath and the curses it spreads, this Pokémon will also, on a whim, cast spells that help people."
430,29,9,It will absolutely not forgive failure from or betrayal by its goons. It has no choice in this if it wants to maintain the order of the flock.
438,29,9,"It discharges moisture from its eyes, making it look like it’s crying—apparently an effective way of getting enemies to let down their guard."
439,29,9,"It does its absolute best to mimic the movements and expressions of its opponents, but it’s still not very good at it."
440,29,9,"Usually it’s a well-behaved Pokémon, but if you take its round rock away, it will cry and fuss and throw a big old tantrum."
443,29,9,"It reacts to anything that moves—flies right at it and bites it. Sometimes it injures itself, but it doesn’t care too much."
444,29,9,"It loves shiny things. When it finds a Sableye trying to catch a Carbink, Gabite becomes furiously angry and attacks the Sableye."
445,29,9,"It flies at the speed of sound while searching for prey, and it has midair battles with Salamence as the two compete for food."
446,29,9,"It hides food under its long fur, but it sometimes forgets about it and causes a stinky disturbance."
447,29,9,It knows how people and Pokémon feel by looking at their auras. It doesn’t approach dangerous opponents.
448,29,9,"It concentrates its mental energy and fires off mysterious waves called auras, which can crush boulders of large size to dust."
456,29,9,"When night falls, their pink patterns begin to shine. They’re popular with divers, so there are resorts that feed them to keep them close."
457,29,9,"Deep down at the bottom of the ocean, prey is scarce. Lumineon get into fierce disputes with Lanturn over food."
458,29,9,It’s highly friendly and easily tamed. Tours that take people swimming with Mantyke are a super-popular beach activity.
461,29,9,"One Weavile will trip a Sandshrew and flip it over, and then another Weavile will deal the finishing blow with its sharp claws."
462,29,9,It uses radar to monitor its territory. Intruders are quickly disposed of with a hyper beam.
463,29,9,A contest is under way to determine which one can stick its tongue out the farthest. The current record is...more than 82 feet.
466,29,9,"It grips its tail, which spews electricity, and then beats down opponents with the power of its electrified fist."
467,29,9,There are still quite a few factories that rely on the flames provided by Magmortar to process metals.
470,29,9,"Although it doesn’t like disputes, it will sharpen the leaf on its tail into a blade and fight if it has to protect its friends."
471,29,9,It protects itself by freezing its fur into sharp needles. It can drop its body temperature below –75 degrees Fahrenheit.
474,29,9,"Its behavior is noticeably unstable, which is apparently due to the incompetence of the engineer who updated its programming."
476,29,9,"Although it can control its units known as Mini-Noses, they sometimes get lost and don’t come back."
478,29,9,It freezes hikers who have come to climb snowy mountains and carries them back to its home. It only goes after men it thinks are handsome.
506,29,9,"This Pokémon has excellent judgment. If it decides it can’t defeat an opponent, it immediately turns tail and vamooses."
507,29,9,"The longer its black fur grows, the harder and more impervious it gets. Claws and fangs can’t easily penetrate it."
508,29,9,"It pays no mind to the cold, thanks to its long warm coat. Stoutland in Alola look a little uncomfortable."
524,29,9,"The hexagonal hole is its ear. Deep in that ear is an energy core, so if you stick your hand in there, Roggenrola will be very angry!"
525,29,9,The energy overflowing from its body has turned into orange crystals that are hard enough to smash diamonds.
526,29,9,"When it fires off energy with all its might, the power creates countless fissures on its body."
546,29,9,"To protect itself, it shoots cotton from its body. When it gets wet in the rain, its cotton grows moist and heavy, and it can’t move as well."
547,29,9,"This nuisance sneaks into people’s homes, where it hides important things and scatters cotton all over the place."
548,29,9,"Some say if you dry the leaves on its head, boil them down, and drink the infusion, your vigor will return, so Petilil is popular with the elderly."
549,29,9,The fragrance of its flower differs slightly depending on the soil where it grew up. Sniffing the aroma calms your heart and mind.
550,29,9,"Savage, violent Pokémon, red and blue Basculin are always fighting each other over territory."
551,29,9,"Alola, where it’s warm all year round, is a comfortable environment for this Pokémon. Sometimes you’ll even see it outside of deserts."
552,29,9,"Krokorok really hates it when its body gets cold. On nights when the temperature drops, it digs deep into the desert sands."
553,29,9,"When it spots prey, even at a distance of over 30 miles, it swims through the desert as if it were water, then jumps out and chomps them."
559,29,9,"They move in small groups, walking around lazily. Anyone who makes eye contact gets smacked with a headbutt."
560,29,9,"This Pokémon may be rude, but it takes very good care of its family, its friends, and its turf."
564,29,9,It was restored from an ancient fossil. Tirtouga lived in the sea but came up onto the land to search for prey.
565,29,9,Its jaws are terrifyingly powerful. It could eat Omastar and Omanyte whole and not be bothered in the slightest by their shells.
566,29,9,"Once thought to be the ancestor of all bird Pokémon, some of the latest research suggests that may not be the case."
567,29,9,"This ancient Pokémon’s plumage is delicate, so if anyone other than an experienced professional tries to restore it, they will fail."
568,29,9,Poisonous gas leaks out of it when it breathes. Muk that catch a whiff of that stench will come drooling.
569,29,9,"It locks opponents in place with its left hand, immobilizing them by entirely dousing their bodies with poisonous liquid."
570,29,9,"This Pokémon has a cowardly disposition, so when it’s not around friends, it basically always stays transformed as something else."
571,29,9,It doesn’t just transform itself—it also has the power to make hundreds of people see its illusions.
572,29,9,"A clean freak that will not allow even the slightest mess, it uses its tail like a mop to thoroughly clean any and all filth."
573,29,9,"The white parts of its coat are covered in an oil secreted from its body, so this Pokémon can slide right away from its enemies’ attacks."
582,29,9,"It exhales cold air that is at –58 degrees Fahrenheit. When it’s in a warm place, it shrinks little by little."
583,29,9,It sprays its enemies with grains of ice to freeze them. Most Vanillish in Alola are smaller than average.
584,29,9,"It blasts blizzards from its two mouths. It can create snow anywhere, so it gets a lot of love from skiers and snowboarders."
587,29,9,"They store up electricity to fly through the air. When thunder cracks at night, sometimes there are almost enough of them to blot out the sky."
592,29,9,It wraps its veillike arms and legs around prey swimming by and drags them down to the depths of the ocean.
593,29,9,"Jellicent is always hanging around fancy cruise ships and tankers, hoping to drag away its prey."
594,29,9,"Fishermen take them along on long voyages, because if you have an Alomomola with you, there’ll be no need for a doctor or medicine."
605,29,9,It controls tremendous psychic power. Most reports of alien sightings are actually just people mistaking Elgyem for an alien.
606,29,9,"With its psychic powers, it rewrites its opponents’ memories. You, too, may have already had your memories rewritten."
619,29,9,"They can often be seen in packs in the morning, slowly moving their bodies through a series of poses."
620,29,9,It overwhelms its opponents with continuous attacks and then slowly stores up power before delivering the finishing blow.
621,29,9,"The red skin on its face is harder than rock. In narrow caves, it squares off against its enemies and charges face-first right into them."
622,29,9,"Its movements are powered by a mysterious energy. It has continued to move since ancient times, so its power may soon run out."
623,29,9,Some say that ancient people invented Golurk to serve as a laborer. It follows its master’s orders faithfully.
624,29,9,"After shredding its prey, it sharpens its blades on a stone by the river. Each Pawniard has its own favorite sharpening stone."
625,29,9,"No matter how strong the Bisharp, it’s said that if the blade on its head is chipped, it will retire from its position as the boss."
627,29,9,"With its powerful legs and sturdy claws, it can crack even the hard shells of Shellder and pluck out their insides."
628,29,9,"The more scars it has on its front, the more heroic it’s considered to be. Those with many scars on their back are mocked by the flock."
629,29,9,"Mandibuzz gives it the bones it wears. Vullaby’s wings are short, so it can’t fly yet, but it jumps around, dreaming of wide open skies."
630,29,9,It skillfully arranges the bones of its prey to construct its nest. Most of the bones are Cubone.
636,29,9,"When battling opponents, it sprays fire from its five horns. The max temperature of the flames can reach nearly 5,500 degrees Fahrenheit."
637,29,9,"As it flies, it scatters its flaming scales. It was feared by ancient people, who referred to it as “the rage of the sun.”"
661,29,9,"While it’s an amiable Pokémon, if you touch it unexpectedly, it will heat up its body in an instant, and you’ll be burned."
662,29,9,"It scatters embers in the tall grass. Then bug Pokémon, frightened by the flames, come flying out, and Fletchinder gobbles them up."
663,29,9,"Its tough wings don’t allow fire to pass through them. A long time ago, firefighters’ outfits were made from Talonflame wings."
667,29,9,"When they’re young, they live with a pride. Once they’re able to hunt prey on their own, they’re kicked out and have to make their own way."
668,29,9,"The males are usually lazy, but when attacked by a strong foe, a male will protect its friends with no regard for its own safety."
669,29,9,"It’s not safe without the power of a flower, but it will keep traveling around until it finds one with the color and shape it wants."
670,29,9,"It raises flowers and uses them as weapons. The more gorgeous the blossom, the more power it contains."
671,29,9,It controls the flowers it grows. The petal blizzards that Florges triggers are overwhelming in their beauty and power.
674,29,9,"It follows Pangoro around like a henchman. When Pancham makes a big mistake, its leaf gets taken away."
675,29,9,This rowdy Pokémon boasts great physical strength. Many Trainers are also smitten by its lively character.
676,29,9,There was an era when aristocrats would compete to see who could trim their Furfrou’s fur into the most exquisite style.
686,29,9,It draws prey near with its blinking lights and then wraps them up in its long tentacles and holds them in place.
687,29,9,"When it comes to strong hypnosis, there’s an endless number of people who utilize Malamar for their nefarious deeds."
690,29,9,It vanishes into seaweed and remains perfectly still to avoid attacks from large Pokémon. Rotten seaweed is its main food source.
691,29,9,"This vicious Pokémon sprays a poisonous liquid on opponents that come near. For whatever reason, it gets along really well with Dhelmise."
692,29,9,"Its claws occasionally fall off, and it keeps a low profile until they grow back. The meat of its claws is so delicious!"
693,29,9,It compresses the water it has sucked up and then projects it with enough power to punch a hole right through a thick sheet of iron.
696,29,9,Its large jaw has incredible destructive power. Some theories suggest that its restored form is different from its form of long ago.
697,29,9,"Complete restoration is impossible, allowing room for theories that its entire body was once covered in a feather-like coat."
698,29,9,"It lived in cold areas in ancient times. It’s said that when Amaura whinnies, auroras appear in the night sky."
699,29,9,"An Aurorus was found frozen solid within a glacier, just as it appeared long ago, which became quite a big event in the news."
700,29,9,"Once a fight breaks out, it will unflinchingly charge at dragon Pokémon that are many times larger than itself."
701,29,9,"It overwhelms opponents with quick moves, but sometimes it showboats for too long when it’s using a special move and gets itself into a pinch."
702,29,9,"It sneaks into people’s homes and steals electricity from their outlets. When your electric bill seems off, it’s the handiwork of this rascal."
703,29,9,"Some say that deep beneath the surface of the world, a pack of Carbink live with their queen in a kingdom of jewels."
704,29,9,"It uses its horns to check out its surroundings. They’re very sensitive, so if you grab them, it will feel a strong shock and be unable to move."
705,29,9,It crawls along sluggishly. The swirly protrusion on its back is filled with its brain and other organs.
706,29,9,"It’s very friendly toward people. If you grow close to it, Goodra will hug you with its sticky, slime-covered body. Don’t get mad."
707,29,9,"Although it’s unclear why it collects keys, giving it a key makes Klefki very happy. However, it apparently only likes master keys."
708,29,9,"By imitating the voice of a child, it causes people to get hopelessly lost deep in the forest. It’s trying to make friends with them."
709,29,9,"It’s feared as a ghost of the forest. Lumberjacks bring along Fire types, which Trevenant hates, when they enter the forest."
714,29,9,Fruits are its favorite foods. This gourmet carefully picks out just the ripe ones using its sonar.
715,29,9,"Although it has a violent disposition, if you give it a nice ripe fruit that it loves, Noivern will suddenly become tame."
718,29,9,This is Zygarde’s form when about half of its pieces have been assembled. It plays the role of monitoring the ecosystem.
722,29,9,"It sends its feathers, which are as sharp as blades, flying in attack. Its legs are strong, so its kicks are also formidable."
723,29,9,"This narcissistic Pokémon is a clean freak. If you don’t groom it diligently, it will stop listening to you."
724,29,9,"It nocks its arrow quills and shoots them at opponents. When it simply can’t afford to miss, it tugs the vine on its head to improve its focus."
725,29,9,"If you try too hard to get close to it, it won’t open up to you. Even if you do grow close, giving it too much affection is still a no-no."
726,29,9,"It can act spoiled if it grows close to its Trainer. A powerful Pokémon, its sharp claws can leave its Trainer’s whole body covered in scratches."
727,29,9,"Although it’s rough mannered and egotistical, it finds beating down unworthy opponents boring. It gets motivated for stronger opponents."
728,29,9,The balloons it inflates with its nose grow larger and larger as it practices day by day.
729,29,9,It gets excited when it sees a dance it doesn’t know. This hard worker practices diligently until it can learn that dance.
730,29,9,"To Primarina, every battle is a stage. It takes down its prey with beautiful singing and dancing."
731,29,9,It pecks at trees with its hard beak. You can get some idea of its mood or condition from the rhythm of its pecking.
732,29,9,It can bend the tip of its beak to produce over a hundred different cries at will.
733,29,9,They smack beaks with others of their kind to communicate. The strength and number of hits tell each other how they feel.
734,29,9,"Its stomach takes up most of its long torso. It’s a big eater, so the amount Trainers have to spend on its food is no laughing matter."
735,29,9,"Although it wasn’t originally found in Alola, this Pokémon was brought over a long time ago when there was a huge Rattata outbreak."
736,29,9,"If you find its nest, you shouldn’t stick your hand inside. You’ll get bitten by an irritated Grubbin."
737,29,9,"It buries itself in fallen leaves and barely moves, munching away on humus. If you accidentally step on one, you’ll get a shock!"
738,29,9,It has an organ that generates electricity in its abdomen. It concentrates energy in its strong jaws and fires off powerful jolts of electricity.
739,29,9,Its hard pincers are well suited to both offense and defense. Fights between two Crabrawler are like boxing matches.
740,29,9,It stores coldness in its pincers and pummels its foes. It can even smash thick walls of ice to bits!
741,29,9,It wins the hearts of its enemies with its passionate dancing and then uses the opening it creates to burn them up with blazing flames.
742,29,9,"Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. In fields of flowers, it gets into skirmishes with Butterfree over food."
743,29,9,"Rain makes pollen damp, so Ribombee hates rain. When it sees ominous clouds, it finds a hollow in a tree, where it waits stock-still."
744,29,9,"As they develop, their disposition grows more violent and aggressive. Many Trainers find them too much to handle and abandon them."
745,29,9,The sharp rocks in its mane can cut like knives. Lycanroc wears its prey down by degrees before finishing them off.
746,29,9,"They’re weak, so they move in schools. However, they can also often be seen all alone, having strayed from the school."
747,29,9,"They eat Corsola branches, so Mareanie are hated by craftsmen who work with Corsola branches that have naturally fallen off."
748,29,9,"To attack, this Pokémon sends toxic spikes flying at its enemies. Ones that come close get mown down by the claws on its feet."
749,29,9,"It loves playing in the mud. If it isn’t showered with mud on a daily basis, it gets stressed out and stops listening to its Trainer."
750,29,9,It remains calm and unmoving no matter the situation. It mixes dirt with the saliva in its mouth to make a special kind of mud.
751,29,9,"When two Dewpider meet, they display their water bubbles to each other. Then the one with the smaller bubble gets out of the other’s way."
752,29,9,"It usually passes its time in the water. When its belly is full, it stores its subdued prey in the water bubble on its head."

756,29,9,"It puts its prey to sleep and siphons off their vitality through the tip of its arms. If one of its kind is weakened, it helps by sending it vitality."
757,29,9,"The males will do whatever the females tell them. They give the females most of their food. Due to malnutrition, the males can’t evolve."
758,29,9,Salazzle lives deep in caves and forces the Salandit it has attracted with its pheromones to serve it.
759,29,9,It boasts power enough to split large trees in half. The organ on its rear releases an odor that it uses to communicate with others of its kind.
760,29,9,It waves its hands wildly in intimidation and warning. Life is over for anyone who doesn’t run away as fast as possible.
761,29,9,"Because of its sweet, delicious aroma, bird Pokémon are always after it, but it’s not intelligent enough to care."
762,29,9,"It’s protected by its hard sepals, so it plays with bird Pokémon without worry. They peck it relentlessly, but it doesn’t care."
763,29,9,"A master of grand and beautiful kicks, it can knock out even kickboxing champions with a single blow."
764,29,9,"It stretches sticky vines out from its head and picks flowers to adorn itself with. When it doesn’t have any flowers, it feels uneasy."
765,29,9,It normally spends its time meditating in the treetops. It throws Poké Balls and gives other Pokémon orders as it pleases.
766,29,9,They use their saliva to stick leaves to their shoulders. You can tell what troop they belong to from the position of the leaves.
767,29,9,"It will pick up anything it finds on the ground. Sometimes it finds coins, so Murkrow and Meowth will go after it."
768,29,9,The shell covering its body is as hard as diamond. This Pokémon will do anything it takes to win.
769,29,9,"It likes the shovel on its head, so Sandygast will get serious and fight any children who come to take it back."
770,29,9,Each of its grains of sand has its own will. Palossand eats small Pokémon and siphons away their vital essence while they’re still alive.
771,29,9,The tradition known as Pyukumuku chucking started from the custom of throwing Pyukumuku back into the sea after they wash onshore.
772,29,9,"A Pokémon weapon developed for a specific mission, it went berserk during an experiment, so it was cryogenically frozen."
773,29,9,"This is its form once it has awakened and evolved. Freed from its heavy mask, its speed is greatly increased."
774,29,9,"It lives in the ozone layer, where it becomes food for stronger Pokémon. When it tries to run away, it falls to the ground."
775,29,9,"It stays asleep from the moment it’s born. When it falls into a deep sleep, it stops moving altogether."
776,29,9,It lives in volcanoes and eats sulfur and other minerals. Materials from the food it eats form the basis of its explosive shell.
777,29,9,"When it’s surprised or agitated, the 14 fur spikes on its back will stand up involuntarily."
778,29,9,"Although it’s a quiet, lonely Pokémon, if you try to look at what’s under its rag, it will become agitated and resist violently."
779,29,9,"It burrows beneath the sand, radiating psychic power from the protuberance on its head. It waits for prey as it surveys the area."
780,29,9,"If a child it has made friends with is bullied, Drampa will find the bully’s house and burn it to the ground."
781,29,9,It wraps its prey in green seaweed and sucks away their vitality. It only likes to go after big prey like Wailord.
782,29,9,It smacks the scales on its head against rocks or against the ground to frighten its opponents. It can also contact its friends with these noises.
783,29,9,"It makes noise by clanging its scales together. When the rhythm has reached its peak, Hakamo-o attacks."
784,29,9,"When it howls after finishing off its prey, the metallic sounds of its celebrating comrades can be heard from all around."
785,29,9,"Although it’s called a guardian deity, if a person or Pokémon puts it in a bad mood, it will become a malevolent deity and attack."
786,29,9,It heals the wounds of people and Pokémon by sprinkling them with its sparkling scales. This guardian deity is worshiped on Akala.
787,29,9,"Although it’s called a guardian deity, it’s violent enough to crush anyone it sees as an enemy."

789,29,9,"Even though its helpless, gaseous body can be blown away by the slightest breeze, it doesn’t seem to care."
790,29,9,The king who ruled Alola in times of antiquity called it the “cocoon of the stars” and built an altar to worship it.
791,29,9,Sometimes the result of its opening an Ultra Wormhole is that energy and life-forms from other worlds are called here to this world.

800,29,9,"It looks somehow pained as it rages around in search of light, which serves as its energy. It’s apparently from another world."
801,29,9,It synchronizes its consciousness with others to understand their feelings. This faculty makes it useful for taking care of people.
802,29,9,"It slips into the shadows of others and mimics their powers and movements. As it improves, it becomes stronger than those it’s imitating."
803,29,9,This Ultra Beast is well enough liked to be chosen as a first partner in its own world.
804,29,9,It stores hundreds of liters of poisonous liquid inside its body. It is one of the organisms known as UBs.
805,29,9,It appeared from an Ultra Wormhole. Each one appears to be made up of many life-forms stacked one on top of each other.
806,29,9,"It slithers toward people. Then, without warning, it triggers the explosion of its own head. It’s apparently one kind of Ultra Beast."
807,29,9,"It electrifies its claws and tears its opponents apart with them. Even if they dodge its attack, they’ll be electrocuted by the flying sparks."
10,30,9,"Its body is soft and weak. In nature, its perpetual fate is to be seen by others as food."
11,30,9,"Its hard shell doesn’t crack a bit even if Pikipek pecks at it, but it will tip over, spilling out its insides."
12,30,9,"Nectar from pretty flowers is its favorite food. In fields of flowers, it has heated battles with Cutiefly for territory."
19,30,9,This Pokémon is common but hazardous. Its sharp incisors can easily cut right through hard wood.
20,30,9,"Its whiskers are essential for maintaining its balance. No matter how friendly you are, it will get angry and bite you if you touch its whiskers."
21,30,9,"Due to its short wings, it can’t fly long distances. It wanders about restlessly and pecks at bug Pokémon."
22,30,9,"In Alola, fish Pokémon are its prey. It can be seen circling above the ocean searching for food."
23,30,9,"The eggs of bird Pokémon are its favorite food. It swallows eggs whole, so sometimes an egg gets stuck, and Ekans faints."
24,30,9,"After stunning its opponents with the pattern on its stomach, it quickly wraps them up in its body and waits for them to stop moving."
25,30,9,"While sleeping, it generates electricity in the sacs in its cheeks. If it’s not getting enough sleep, it will be able to use only weak electricity."
26,30,9,"Because so many Trainers like the way Pikachu looks, you don’t see this Pokémon very often."
27,30,9,"When its skin gets wrinkled from moisture, it heads for a volcano. It lies flat on a spot with a lot of geothermal heat and dries itself out."
28,30,9,"Thanks to its thick claws, it’s good at climbing trees. There are plenty of Sandslash that park themselves in trees and go right to sleep."
35,30,9,"Bathed in moonlight, its wings glow faintly. Without even flapping, Clefairy rises into the air, where it dances around."
36,30,9,Some scientists believe that it gazes intently at the sky on nights with a full moon because it’s homesick.
37,30,9,"It manipulates balls of fire to catch its prey. If you raise one from when it’s young, it will grow close to you like a puppy Pokémon."
38,30,9,"The flickering flames it spews from its mouth leave its opponents hypnotized. Then, this extremely intelligent Pokémon attacks."
39,30,9,The songs they sing are totally different depending on the region they live in. Some even sound like they’re shouting!
40,30,9,"When it gets angry, it inhales with all its might, and its body gradually inflates. Sometimes they can grow 20 times larger!"
41,30,9,"Their skin is so thin that they’ll be burned if sunlight hits them. When it gets cold out, they gather together to warm one another’s bodies."
42,30,9,They can suck down over 10 ounces of blood in one go. They have been known to drink so much blood that they can no longer fly.
46,30,9,"The mushrooms, known as tochukaso, are controlling the bug. Even if the bug bugs the mushrooms, they tell it to bug off."
47,30,9,"Its poisonous spores are also used in traditional medicine. Apparently, spores produced in Alola are not of very good quality."
50,30,9,"Around their crops, farmers plant the kind of tree that Diglett like to eat as a way of getting Diglett to plow the fields for them."
51,30,9,Dugtrio’s heads are sleek and smooth and incredibly hard. It can dig through any soil with its headbutts.
52,30,9,"It loves coins, so if you give it one, you can make friends with Meowth easily. But it’s fickle, so you can’t count on that friendship lasting."
53,30,9,This Pokémon is popular with rich people. It’s also targeted by hunters who are after the jewel in its forehead.
54,30,9,It has been found that its brain cells are 10 times more active when Psyduck is experiencing a headache.
55,30,9,"A professional swimmer, it can continue swimming for two days straight by waving its long tail skillfully."
56,30,9,"If one gets angry, all the others around it will get angry, so silence is a rare visitor in a troop of Mankey."
57,30,9,"The blood vessels in its brain are sturdier than those of other Pokémon, so it can stay healthy despite its constant raging."
58,30,9,It has lived alongside humans since ages ago. Its bones have been found in excavations of ruins from the Stone Age.
59,30,9,"There are so many old tales about them that they’re called legendary Pokémon, but there are way more of them around than you’d expect."
60,30,9,The direction of the swirl on their stomachs differs depending on where they live. Poliwag aficionados can tell them apart at a glance.
61,30,9,"Its health suffers when its skin dries out, so be sure to moisturize it diligently."
62,30,9,"The muscles it has developed through swimming are thick and powerful. When it lands a square punch, it can turn huge boulders to dust."
63,30,9,It can read others’ minds and will teleport away when danger approaches. You must clear your mind if you want to catch it.
64,30,9,"It possesses strong mental capabilities, but its psychic powers are halved when it’s not holding a silver spoon."
65,30,9,"If it trusts someone deeply, it will let them have one of its spoons. Anything you eat with that spoon is apparently delicious."
66,30,9,It likes food that’s highly nutritious because its instincts drive it to build muscle efficiently.
67,30,9,"A popular motif for sculptures, its incredibly well-developed muscles have captured the imagination of many an artist."
68,30,9,"With four arms, it can attack and defend simultaneously. It’s said to have mastered every martial art in the world."
72,30,9,Its body is 99% water. The remaining 1% contains the organ that makes its poison.
73,30,9,"It communicates with others of its kind by lighting up the red orbs on its head. When the orbs are blinking, it’s a warning sign."
74,30,9,It uses both hands to climb precipitous cliffs. People who see it in action have been known to take up bouldering.
75,30,9,"It travels by rolling down cliffs. If it falls into a river, it will explode with its last gasp."
76,30,9,It detonates its own body. The power from that explosion can propel it up steep mountain paths with amazing speed.
79,30,9,"Although their tails, which fall off naturally, can easily be found lying around, they’re a precious ingredient for cooking."
80,30,9,"Shellder, in its greed to suck out more and more sweetness from Slowbro’s tail, has metamorphosed into a spiral-shaped shell."
81,30,9,"Perhaps because electrical lines are often buried these days, the number of Magnemite attacks on power plants has increased."
82,30,9,"When rain clouds form, many Magneton gather in high places to wait for lightning to strike."
86,30,9,"Thanks to its thick fat, cold seas don’t bother it at all, but it gets tired pretty easily in warm waters."
87,30,9,It sunbathes on the beach after meals. The rise in its body temperature helps its digestion.
88,30,9,"The wastewater coming from factories is clean these days, so Grimer have nothing to eat. They’re said to be on the verge of extinction."
89,30,9,"Because they scatter germs everywhere, they’ve long been targeted for extermination, leading to a steep decline in their population."
90,30,9,"Even when its shell is closed, its tongue still hangs out. If you give its tongue a good yank, the shock will cause Shellder to open its shell."
91,30,9,Slowpoke tails are its favorite food. It has even been known to come up on land to look for Slowpoke from time to time.
92,30,9,Poisonous gas comprises 95% of its body. It’s said that the remaining 5% is made up of the souls of those who died from the gas.
93,30,9,"It’s dangerous to go outside alone on nights when you’re feeling sad. Haunter will catch you, and you won’t be able to go back home."
94,30,9,Even your home isn’t safe. Gengar will lurk in whatever dark corner of a room it can find and wait for its chance to catch its prey.
96,30,9,"It puts its prey to sleep and devours their dreams. It seems that bad dreams taste sour, so Drowzee doesn’t particularly like eating them."
97,30,9,There are some Hypno that assist doctors with patients who can’t sleep at night in hospitals.
102,30,9,"Although they are the same size as other Exeggcute, the ones produced in Alola are quite heavy. Their shells are packed full."
103,30,9,"Each of its three heads has its own thoughts. When they want to go in different directions, Exeggutor becomes unable to move."
104,30,9,"It wears its mother’s skull on its head, so no one knows what its bare face looks like. However, it’s clear that it’s always crying."
105,30,9,They thump their bones rhythmically to communicate among themselves. There are nearly 50 different rhythmic patterns.
108,30,9,"It licks filth clean with its tongue. Whatever it licks always stinks afterward, so whether it’s really clean is...questionable."
113,30,9,"Because the eggs on their bellies have been overharvested by people in the past, the Chansey population remains very small."
115,30,9,You shouldn’t get close to the child when it’s playing outside its mother’s pouch. Its mother is always nearby watching over it.
118,30,9,The way it swims along fluttering its dress-like fins has earned it the name “princess of the water.”
119,30,9,"To attract females, males dance on the river’s floor. The females gather around the male that dances most gracefully."
120,30,9,No number of injuries can bother Staryu. Its amazing regenerative powers return it to its previous state in half a day!
121,30,9,It rotates its geometrically shaped body to swim through the water. It always seems to be sending out mysterious radio waves.
122,30,9,"It creates invisible walls with its pantomiming. If you don’t act impressed, it will attack you with a double slap!"
123,30,9,Some call it a ninja. Its movements— imperceptibly quick—are sufficient to cleave the air in two. It’s very popular in Alola.
124,30,9,Its strange cries sound like human language. There are some musicians who compose songs for Jynx to sing.
125,30,9,"While it’s often blamed for power outages, the truth is the cause of outages is more often an error on the part of the electric company."
126,30,9,"The hotter the place, the better they feel. Magmar in Alola are said to be hardier than those in other areas."
127,30,9,"Although it’s tough, it can’t handle cold well. When night falls, it buries itself in leafage and sleeps."
128,30,9,The climate seems to be related to the reason Tauros in Alola are a little calmer than those in other regions.
129,30,9,"Thanks to their strong hold on life, dirty water doesn’t bother them at all. They live in waters all over the world!"
130,30,9,"The energy from evolution stimulated its brain cells strongly, causing it to become very ferocious."
131,30,9,They’ve been so cherished that there’s now an overabundance. The fish Pokémon population has declined in waters with too many Lapras.
132,30,9,"It transforms into whatever it sees. If the thing it’s transforming into isn’t right in front of it, Ditto relies on its memory—so sometimes it fails."
133,30,9,Its genes are easily influenced by its surroundings. Even its face starts to look like that of its Trainer.
134,30,9,"It detects nearby moisture with its fin. When its fin begins trembling rapidly, that means rain will fall in a few hours."
135,30,9,"Its fur stands on end, becoming like needles it fires at enemies. Once they’re weakened, it finishes them off with a 10,000 volt shock."
136,30,9,"The flame chamber inside its body ignites when Flareon gets agitated, reaching temperatures of up to 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit."
137,30,9,It was built 20 years ago by scientists who dreamed of exploring space. Their dreams have yet to come true.
138,30,9,"It was restored from an ancient fossil. Those Helix Fossils are excavated from areas that were once oceans long, long ago."
139,30,9,It wraps its prey in its tentacles to immobilize them and then finishes them off with its sharp fangs.
140,30,9,"This Pokémon became extinct everywhere, except in a few areas. It protects itself with its hard shell."
141,30,9,"It swims at speeds of roughly 29 knots, quickly closing in on its prey and slashing into them with its scythes to finish them off."
142,30,9,"It flew through the open skies over the ancient continent as if they were its own. When it touched ground, its walk was weak and slow."
143,30,9,"It has no interest in anything other than eating. Even if you climb up on its stomach while it’s napping, it doesn’t seem to mind at all!"
147,30,9,It sheds its skin—almost on a daily basis—and grows larger. Its skin is soft just after it’s been shed.
148,30,9,"Some say that if you see it at the start of the year, flying through the sky and twisting its body, you’ll be healthy all year long."
149,30,9,You’ll often hear tales of this kindhearted Pokémon rescuing people or Pokémon that are drowning.
163,30,9,"It cries out at the same time every day. A long time ago, people cherished it and considered it a divine messenger sent to tell the time."
164,30,9,"When it turns its head entirely upside down, you know it’s troubled by something. If you don’t leave it be, it will peck you."
165,30,9,These very cowardly Pokémon join together and use Reflect to protect their nest.
166,30,9,"It flies through the night sky, sprinkling sparkly dust. According to some, if that dust sticks to you, good things will happen to you."
167,30,9,"Although the poison from its fangs isn’t that strong, it’s potent enough to weaken prey that gets caught in its web."
168,30,9,"It spews threads from its mouth to catch its prey. When night falls, it leaves its web to go hunt aggressively."
169,30,9,"It feeds on the blood of living people and Pokémon. If it can’t drink any blood for even a short while, it becomes weak and unable to fly."
170,30,9,Chinchou blink their shining antennae at one another to claim their respective turf.
171,30,9,"It lives far down in the depths of the ocean. It blinds its prey with light, using the moment they’re dazzled to swallow them whole."
172,30,9,"It has electric sacs in its cheeks. When they’re fully charged, Pichu plays very energetically."
173,30,9,"Said to have ridden here on a shooting star, Cleffa seem to appear in places where meteorites have struck in the past."
174,30,9,"Left to its own devices, it will constantly practice singing. You should make it take a break so it doesn’t hurt its throat."
177,30,9,"The look in its eyes gives the impression that it’s carefully observing you. If you approach it, Natu will hop away."
178,30,9,"While it can see the future, it has no desire to change it, which is probably why it remains motionless at all times."
179,30,9,"Rubbing its fleece generates electricity. You’ll want to pet it because it’s cute, but if you use your bare hand, you’ll get a painful shock."
180,30,9,"It stores electricity in its fluffy fleece. If it stores up too much, it will start to go bald in those patches."
181,30,9,Its tail shines bright and strong. It has been prized since long ago as a beacon for sailors.
185,30,9,The result of its holding the same pose all the time is arms that have become supple yet strong.
186,30,9,"The longer and more luxurious the curled hair on its head, the greater the number of Poliwag and Poliwhirl that will obey it."
190,30,9,"It searches for prey from the tops of trees. When it spots its favorite food, Bounsweet, Aipom gets excited and pounces."
196,30,9,Psychic power builds up in the orb on its forehead as it bathes in the sunshine. Espeon is not good at battling at night.
197,30,9,"It lurks in the dark of night looking for prey. At the moment it pounces, the rings on its body glow dimly but ominously."
198,30,9,"It searches for shiny things for its boss. Murkrow’s presence is said to be unlucky, so many people detest it."
199,30,9,"It’s called “the sage of the sea.” It engages in battles of wits with Oranguru, but the result is usually a draw."
200,30,9,What makes it happy is imitating the voices of weeping people and scaring everyone. It doesn’t deal well with folks who aren’t easily frightened.
204,30,9,"It sticks tree bark to itself with its saliva, making itself thicker and larger. Elderly Pineco are ridiculously huge."
205,30,9,"In the moment that it gulps down its prey, the inside of its shell is exposed, but to this day, no one has ever seen that sight."
206,30,9,"When it sees a person, it digs a hole with its tail to make its escape. If you happen to find one, consider yourself lucky."
209,30,9,"In contrast to its appearance, it’s quite timid. When playing with other puppy Pokémon, it sometimes gets bullied."
210,30,9,"Although it’s popular with young people, Granbull is timid and sensitive, so it’s totally incompetent as a watchdog."
212,30,9,"Once it has identified something as an enemy, it will continue beating them with its steel-hard pincers until there’s nothing left but scraps."
214,30,9,"It roams through forests searching for sweet nectar. Although it boasts fantastic physical strength, it’s not that good at flying."
215,30,9,"It blends into the dark of night to ambush its prey. Sneasel will attack Sandshrew, but its hard skin can cause Sneasel’s claws to snap off."
222,30,9,"In Alola, where their natural enemies Mareanie are plentiful, many Corsola have stubby branches on their heads."
223,30,9,"Also known as the “sniper of the seas,” its water gun can hit prey without fail from over 300 feet away."
224,30,9,It usually sleeps in caves. The pitch-black ink that Octillery spits is also used for cooking.
225,30,9,It wraps food in its tail to carry it around. The Delibird with the biggest tail is the boss of the flock!
226,30,9,Many people have taken up surfing because they admire how magnificently Mantine swims.
227,30,9,"Its body is draped in steel armor. It looks heavy, but it can fly at speeds of up to 185 miles an hour!"
228,30,9,They make repeated eerie howls before dawn to call attention to their pack.
229,30,9,"Identifiable by its eerie howls, people a long time ago thought it was the grim reaper and feared it."
233,30,9,"Even though it doesn’t die in the vacuum of space, it can’t move around very well in zero gravity."
235,30,9,"It draws symbols with the fluid that oozes from the tip of its tail. Depending on the symbol, Smeargle fanatics will pay big money for them."
238,30,9,"Highly perceptive sensors, Smoochum’s lips are kept moist by its daily application of tree sap."
239,30,9,"When its horns shine a bluish white, that’s the sign it’s fully charged. You’ll get a shocking jolt if you touch it!"
240,30,9,"Its body temperature is always around 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit. If Magby falls into a small- enough pond, the whole thing will dry up."
241,30,9,"Its milk is delicious and chock-full of nutrients. However, if you drink too much, it could make your stomach hurt, so be careful."
242,30,9,"This Pokémon is overflowing with love. Only Chansey that share a strong bond with their Trainer can evolve, so people say."
246,30,9,"Raised on nutrients it finds in the dirt, it eats roughly a mountain’s worth of dirt before it becomes a pupa."
247,30,9,"This dangerous pupa thrashes about. Its shell is as hard as bedrock, containing its gradually forming new body within."
248,30,9,"This Pokémon is a mobile disaster, leaving mountains crumbled and houses destroyed in its wake."
278,30,9,It builds nests in cliffs by the sea. It circles the skies above the ocean looking for its favorite food—Wishiwashi.
279,30,9,It scoops up Wishiwashi in its huge beak and swallows them whole. It can devour more than 30 at one go!
283,30,9,"It lives in ponds and marshes that feature lots of plant life. It often fights with Dewpider, whose habitat and diet are similar."
284,30,9,"Its thin, winglike antennae are highly absorbent. It waits out rainy days in tree hollows."
296,30,9,There’s a rumor of a traditional recipe for stew that Trainers can use to raise strong Makuhita.
297,30,9,Hariyama that are big and fat aren’t necessarily strong. There are some small ones that move nimbly and use moves skillfully.
299,30,9,It hunts without twitching a muscle by pulling in its prey with powerful magnetism. But sometimes it pulls natural enemies in close.
302,30,9,Materials from gems it has eaten float to the surface of its body and can form an infinite number of patterns among individuals.
303,30,9,"It has two mouths. The big jaws on the back of its head can’t taste anything, so that’s the mouth it uses to eat foods it doesn’t like."
309,30,9,Static electricity builds up all over its body as strands of its long fur rub together. This Pokémon boasts incredible speed.
310,30,9,"It stimulates its own muscles with electricity, so it can move quickly. It eases its soreness with electricity, too, so it can recover quickly as well."
318,30,9,"With its sturdy jaws and fangs, it can easily chomp wooden boats to splinters. It fights with Basculin over food."
319,30,9,It drinks in seawater and jets it from its rear to propel itself. It’s very sensitive to the scent of blood.
320,30,9,"Due to their memories of when they once lived on land, pods of them will, very rarely, wash up on shore."
321,30,9,"When a small Wailmer is attacked by Sharpedo or Dhelmise, its whole pod works together to protect it."
324,30,9,"It burns coal to produce energy. When it has burned through all of its coal, it becomes unable to move."
327,30,9,"Each Spinda’s spot pattern is different. With its stumbling movements, it evades opponents’ attacks brilliantly!"
328,30,9,"It builds nests that double as traps, lying in wait for its prey to get caught. When night falls, it digs itself a spot beneath the sand to sleep."
329,30,9,It vibrates its wings to send out odd sound waves. Trainers who are with it need earplugs.
330,30,9,People continue to have their hearts stolen by its enchanting songs and find themselves stranded in the desert.
339,30,9,Its whiskers are filled with nerves. They can sense smells and flavors just as a person’s nose or tongue would.
340,30,9,Its vision is not that good. It senses vibrations in the water with its whiskers to determine the location of its prey.
341,30,9,It can adapt very well to its environment. Feebas and Corphish are about the only Pokémon to live in stagnant ditches.
342,30,9,"Its pincers often fall off. Unlike with Crabrawler or Clauncher, the meat in its claws is utterly nasty and stinking."
343,30,9,"When they find others of their kind, they cry out loudly and gather together. Large numbers of them can be found in old graveyards."
344,30,9,The ancient people who made it apparently modeled it after something that descended from the sky. It fires beams from both arms.
345,30,9,It sticks to rocks with its powerful suckers and can’t be washed away no matter how rough the surf gets.
346,30,9,This carnivorous Pokémon lived in primordial seas. It catches prey in its eight tentacles and dissolves them with digestive fluid as it eats.
347,30,9,"This is one kind of primeval bug Pokémon. With eight wings, it could apparently swim a lot faster than you’d expect."
348,30,9,Armaldo adapted from living in water to living on land. It has been determined that it is the ancestor of some bug Pokémon.
349,30,9,"Because of its wretched appearance, most people pay it no attention, but there are some who collect Feebas—and Feebas alone!"
350,30,9,Its dwelling place is the bottom of big lakes. Those who behold its loveliness are said to have their hearts purified.
351,30,9,"Its form changes depending on the weather. The rougher conditions get, the rougher Castform’s disposition!"
352,30,9,"Its color changes for concealment and also when its mood or health changes. The darker the color, the healthier it is."
353,30,9,"There’s a proverb that says, “Shun the house where Shuppet gather in the growing dusk.”"
354,30,9,"Resentment at being cast off made it spring into being. Some say that treating it well will satisfy it, and it will once more become a stuffed toy."
357,30,9,"Bunches of delicious fruit grow around its neck. In warm areas, many ranches raise Tropius."
359,30,9,"The elderly call it the disaster Pokémon and detest it, but interest in its power to predict disasters is on the rise."
361,30,9,Rich people from cold areas all share childhood memories of playing with Snorunt.
362,30,9,Its actual body is a rock that isn’t particularly hard. Glalie absorbs moisture from the air and drapes itself in an armor of ice.
366,30,9,Clamperl’s pearls are exceedingly precious. They can be more than 10 times as costly as Shellder’s pearls.
367,30,9,"Deep seas are their habitat. According to tradition, when Huntail wash up onshore, something unfortunate will happen."
368,30,9,"It sucks bodily fluids out of its prey. The leftover meat sinks to the seafloor, where it becomes food for other Pokémon."
369,30,9,The reason it hasn’t changed at all in a hundred million years is that it’s apparently already a perfect life-form.
370,30,9,Luvdisc makes its home in coral reefs in warm seas. It especially likes sleeping in the space between Corsola’s branches.
371,30,9,Some theories suggest that its behavior of forcefully bashing its head into things stimulates cells that affect its evolution.
372,30,9,"Shelgon lives deep within caves. It stays shut up in its hard shell, dreaming of the day it will be able to fly."
373,30,9,"Thanks to its fervent wishes, the cells in its body finally mutated, and at last it has its heart’s desire—wings."
374,30,9,"If you anger it, it will do more than rampage. It will also burst out strong magnetism, causing nearby machines to break."
375,30,9,"It flies at high speeds around the skies. When it finds its prey, Metang takes a firm grip with its sharp claws and never lets go."
376,30,9,"It analyzes its opponents with more accuracy than a supercomputer, which enables it to calmly back them into a corner."
408,30,9,"Its hard skull is its distinguishing feature. It snapped trees by headbutting them, and then it fed on their ripe berries."
409,30,9,"This ancient Pokémon used headbutts skillfully. Its brain was really small, so some theories suggest that its stupidity led to its extinction."
410,30,9,"Although its fossils can be found in layers of primeval rock, nothing but its face has ever been discovered."
411,30,9,This Pokémon is from roughly 100 million years ago. Its terrifyingly tough face is harder than steel.
422,30,9,"When it senses danger, a purple liquid oozes out of it. The liquid is thought to be something like greasy sweat."
423,30,9,"Their shape and color change, depending on their environment and diet. There are many of them at beaches where the waves are calm."
424,30,9,"It uses its tails for everything. If it wraps both of its tails around you and gives you a squeeze, that’s proof it really likes you."
425,30,9,"Wandering souls gathered together to form this Pokémon. When trying to make friends with children, Drifloon grabs them by the hand."
426,30,9,"The raw material for the gas inside its body is souls. When its body starts to deflate, it’s thought to carry away people and Pokémon."
427,30,9,The reason it keeps one ear rolled up is so it can launch a swift counterattack if it’s attacked by an enemy.
428,30,9,"It’s notably wary and has a dislike of fighting, but at the same time, it can deliver powerful kicks with its lithe legs."
429,30,9,Its muttered curses can cause awful headaches or terrifying visions that torment others.
430,30,9,Its goons take care of most of the fighting for it. The only time it dirties its own hands is in delivering a final blow to finish off an opponent.
438,30,9,"If its body gets too damp, it will die. So, in a process reminiscent of sweating, its eyes expel moisture."
439,30,9,"When this gifted mimic surprises an opponent, Mime Jr. feels so happy that it ends up forgetting it was imitating something."
440,30,9,"When it sees something round and white, Happiny puts it into the pouch on its stomach. It sometimes becomes overloaded and can’t move."
443,30,9,"Its original home is an area much hotter than Alola. If you’re planning to live with one, your heating bill will soar."
444,30,9,It sheds its skin and gradually grows larger. Its scales can be ground into a powder and used as raw materials for traditional medicine.
445,30,9,Its fine scales don’t just reduce wind resistance—their sharp edges also cause injury to any opponent who attacks it.
446,30,9,"Anything that looks edible, Munchlax will go on and swallow whole. Its stomach is tough enough to handle it even if the food has gone rotten."
447,30,9,"It uses waves called auras to communicate with others of its kind. It doesn’t make any noise during this time, so its enemies can’t detect it."
448,30,9,"Lucario reads its opponent’s feelings with its aura waves. It finds out things it would rather not know, so it gets stressed out easily."
456,30,9,It lures in prey with its shining tail fins. It stays near the surface during the day and moves to the depths when night falls.
457,30,9,They traverse the deep waters as if crawling over the seafloor. The fantastic lights of its fins shine like stars in the night sky.
458,30,9,Mantyke are friendly toward people and will approach boats closely. The patterns on their backs differ depending on their habitat.
461,30,9,"Thanks to its increased intelligence, scrapping over food is a thing of the past. A scratch from its claws will give you a case of frostbite!"
462,30,9,There are still people who believe that this Pokémon came from outer space. It emanates a powerful magnetic field.
463,30,9,It uses its tongue much more skillfully than its hands or its feet. It can deftly pick up a single small bean with its tongue.
466,30,9,A single Electivire can provide enough electricity for all the buildings in a big city for a year.
467,30,9,"Magmortar takes down its enemies by shooting fireballs, which burn them to a blackened crisp. It avoids this method when hunting prey."
470,30,9,It gets its nutrition from photosynthesis. It lives a quiet life deep in forests where clean rivers flow.
471,30,9,"It can instantaneously freeze any moisture that’s around it, creating ice pellets to shoot at its prey."
474,30,9,"A faulty update was added to its programming. Its behavior is noticeably strange, so the experiment may have been a failure."
476,30,9,It uses three small units to catch prey and battle enemies. The main body mostly just gives orders.
478,30,9,"It’s said that on nights of terrible blizzards, it comes down to human settlements. If you hear it knocking at your door, do not open it!"
506,30,9,"This Pokémon is popular with beginners because it’s intelligent, obedient to its Trainer’s commands, and easy to raise."
507,30,9,"It has been living with people for so long that portrayals of it can be found on the walls of caves from long, long ago."
508,30,9,"Its fur is long and thick. A long time ago in cold regions, every household kept a Stoutland."
524,30,9,It was found in a fissure in a layer of exposed rock. The material that makes up its body is dirt from several hundred years ago.
525,30,9,"Its orange crystals are lumps of powerful energy. They’re valuable, so Boldore is sometimes targeted for them."
526,30,9,It absorbs rays of sunlight and shoots out energy. It’s usually lurking deep beneath the surface.
546,30,9,"When attacked, it expels cotton from its body to create a diversion. The cotton it loses grows back in quickly."
547,30,9,"Whimsicott doesn’t live in a fixed location. It floats around on whirling winds, appearing all over the place to perform its mischief."
548,30,9,"They prefer clean water and soil. When the environment they live in turns bad, the whole bunch will up and move to a new area."
549,30,9,"It’s well liked by other Pokémon because of its beauty. The flower on its head needs constant care, or it will soon wither and rot."
550,30,9,"When a school of Basculin appears in a lake, everything else disappears, except for Corphish and Crawdaunt. That’s how violent Basculin are."
551,30,9,"Sandile’s still not good at hunting, so it mostly eats things that have collapsed in the desert. It’s called “the cleaner of the desert.”"
552,30,9,It buries some of its prey in the sand to use as emergency meals when its hunts are unsuccessful.
553,30,9,It conceals itself in sandstorms that Flygon whip up and waits patiently for prey to appear.
559,30,9,"It stretches its saggy skin up to its neck to protect itself. The saggier their skin, the more respect they garner."

564,30,9,"Its hunting grounds encompassed a broad area, from the land to more than half a mile deep in the ocean."
565,30,9,"Carracosta eats every last bit of the prey it catches, even the shells and bones, to further strengthen its sturdy shell."
566,30,9,"Restored from a fossil, this ancient bird Pokémon has wings but can’t yet fly."
567,30,9,"Said to be an ancestor of bird Pokémon, the muscles it uses to flap its wings are still weak, so it needs a long runway in order to take off."
568,30,9,"If a young Pokémon or child breathes in the toxic gas that Trubbish belches out, it could be a life-threatening situation."
569,30,9,"Some say the reason Garbodor in Alola are a little stronger than their counterparts elsewhere is the presence of Muk, their natural enemy."
570,30,9,"If a normally talkative child suddenly stops talking, it may have been replaced by Zorua."
571,30,9,"If it thinks humans are going to discover its den, Zoroark shows them visions that make them wander around in the woods."
572,30,9,"When its tail has gotten dirty from self-cleaning or from cleaning its nest, Minccino spends a whole day washing its tail in clean spring water."
573,30,9,"The oil that seeps from its body is really smooth. For people troubled by bad skin, this oil is an effective treatment."
582,30,9,"When the morning sun hit an icicle, it wished not to melt, and thus Vanillite was born. At night, it buries itself in snow to sleep."
583,30,9,This hearty Pokémon survived the Ice Age. It’s incredibly popular in very hot regions.
584,30,9,"Vanilluxe is born when two Vanillish, half-melted by the day’s light, stick to each other and freeze together in the cold return of night."
587,30,9,"As it flies, it scatters electricity around, so bird Pokémon keep their distance. That’s why Emolga can keep all its food to itself."
592,30,9,"Using the invisible poison spikes on its veillike arms and legs, it paralyzes its enemies and causes them to drown."
593,30,9,Fishermen are terrified of Jellicent. It’s rumored to drag them into the sea and steal their lives away.
594,30,9,The reason it helps Pokémon in a weakened condition is that any Pokémon coming after them may also attack Alomomola.
605,30,9,This Pokémon is shrouded in mystery. It’s said to have appeared from a UFO that fell from the sky about 50 years ago.
606,30,9,"It has strong psychic powers. Using its fingers that flash three different colors, it controls its opponents and rewrites their memories."
619,30,9,They seclude themselves in the mountains and devote themselves to training. The form of their kicks and chops differs from pack to pack.
620,30,9,"When Mienshao lets out a bizarre wail, you’re in danger. A flurry of kicks and chops too fast to see is about to be unleashed!"
621,30,9,It infiltrates tunnels that Pokémon like Diglett and Dugtrio have dug and quietly waits for prey to pass through.
622,30,9,"Although ancient people apparently built it by working with clay, the source of its energy is unclear."
623,30,9,"When the seal on its chest is removed, it rages indiscriminately, turning the whole town around it into a mountain of rubble."
624,30,9,"It follows Bisharp’s orders to a tee when it attacks enemies. After slashing an opponent, Pawniard clangs both of its blades together."

628,30,9,"Known as “the hero of the skies,” this Pokémon is so proud and so brave that it will never retreat, even when it’s injured."
629,30,9,Its healthy appetite leads to visible growth spurts. It often has to replace the bones it wears as its size increases.
630,30,9,"It’s always searching for food for Vullaby. When it finds a weak Pokémon, Mandibuzz swoops it right off to its nest."
636,30,9,"It protects itself with flame. Long years ago, people believed Larvesta had a nest on the sun."
637,30,9,"According to legends, it was hatched from a flaming cocoon to save people and Pokémon that were suffering from the cold."

662,30,9,Its speed right after takeoff already puts it in the top speed class of all bird Pokémon.
663,30,9,Bird Pokémon make up most of its diet. It approaches at high speeds and smacks them down to the ground with its powerful kick.

668,30,9,"The temperature of its breath is over 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, but Pyroar doesn’t use it on its prey. This Pokémon prefers to eat raw meat."
669,30,9,Flabébé wears a crown made from pollen it’s collected from its flower. The crown has hidden healing properties.
670,30,9,"It gives its own power to flowers, pouring its heart into caring for them. Floette never forgives anyone who messes up a flower bed."
671,30,9,Its life can span several hundred years. It’s said to devote its entire life to protecting gardens.
674,30,9,It’s desperate to intimidate its opponents. Be nice and pretend to be scared if you catch it glaring at you intensely.
675,30,9,Pangoro is the type to talk with its fists. It doesn’t say much as it pummels opponents with enough force to send a dump truck flying.
676,30,9,"Left alone, its fur will grow longer and longer, but it will only allow someone it trusts to cut it."
686,30,9,"When exchanging information with others of its kind, it flashes the light-emitting spots on its body in a complex rhythm."
687,30,9,It flashes the pattern on its torso to control its prey and draw them in. The edges of its fins are supremely sharp.
690,30,9,"It’s not good at swimming, so it clings to the seaweed. In the Alola region, it’s often found near Dhelmise."
691,30,9,It blends in with seaweed to ambush its prey and then takes them down with a poisonous liquid strong enough to melt metal.
692,30,9,"It moves around by jetting water from its right pincer. It has a poor sense of balance, so it’s terrible at swimming straight."
693,30,9,"Its right arm is packed with meat. When its pincer falls off, it’s exported to be used as a cooking ingredient."
696,30,9,"Tyrunt is spoiled and selfish. It may just be trying to frolic, but sometimes the ones it’s trying to frolic with are gravely injured."

772,30,9,"There’s danger of its going on a rampage, so its true power is sealed away beneath its control mask."
773,30,9,"Through the bond it formed with its Trainer, its will was strengthened, and it was able to destroy its control mask."
774,30,9,"Although its outer shell is uncommonly durable, the shock of falling to the ground smashes the shell to smithereens."
775,30,9,It remains asleep from birth to death as a result of the sedative properties of the leaves that form its diet.
776,30,9,"Its exploding shell poses a real danger but is sensitive to moisture. On rainy days, Turtonator takes silent refuge in caves."

615,33,9,"With its icy chains, Cryogonal freezes those it encounters. It then takes its victims away to somewhere unknown."

730,34,9,"For Primarina, every battle’s a stage. Its singing and the dancing of its balloons will mesmerize the audience."
736,34,9,"It uses its big jaws to dig nests into the forest floor, and it loves to feed on sweet tree sap."
737,34,9,Its digestive processes convert the leaves it eats into electricity. An electric sac in its belly stores the electricity for later use.
738,34,9,"If it carries a Charjabug to use as a spare battery, a flying Vikavolt can rapidly fire high-powered beams of electricity."
742,34,9,An opponent’s aura can tell Cutiefly what that opponent’s next move will be. Then Cutiefly can glide around the attack and strike back.
743,34,9,"Ribombee absolutely hate getting wet or rained on. In the cloudy Galar region, they are very seldom seen."
744,34,9,"This Pokémon intimidates opponents by striking the ground with the rocks on its neck. The moment an opponent flinches, Rockruff attacks."
745,34,9,"With swift movements, this Pokémon gradually backs its prey into a corner. Lycanroc’s fangs are always aimed toward opponents’ weak spots."
746,34,9,"When it senses danger, its eyes tear up. The sparkle of its tears signals other Wishiwashi to gather."
747,34,9,"Unlike their Alolan counterparts, the Mareanie of the Galar region have not yet figured out that the branches of Corsola are delicious."
748,34,9,Within the poison sac in its body is a poison so toxic that Pokémon as large as Wailord will still be suffering three days after it first takes effect.
749,34,9,"It eats dirt to create mud and smears this mud all over its feet, giving them the grip needed to walk on rough terrain without slipping."
750,34,9,Mudsdale has so much stamina that it could carry over 10 tons across the Galar region without rest or sleep.
751,34,9,"Dewpider normally lives underwater. When it comes onto land in search of food, it takes water with it in the form of a bubble on its head."
752,34,9,"It acts as a caretaker for Dewpider, putting them inside its bubble and letting them eat any leftover food."
753,34,9,"During the day, Fomantis basks in sunlight and sleeps peacefully. It wakes and moves around at night."
754,34,9,"The petals on this Pokémon’s arms are thin and super sharp, and they can fire laser beams if Lurantis gathers light first."
755,34,9,Morelull live in forests that stay dark even during the day. They scatter flickering spores that put enemies to sleep.
756,34,9,"If you see a light deep in a forest at night, don’t go near. Shiinotic will make you fall fast asleep."
757,34,9,This sneaky Pokémon will slink behind its prey and immobilize it with poisonous gas before the prey even realizes Salandit is there.
758,34,9,The winner of competitions between Salazzle is decided by which one has the most male Salandit with it.
759,34,9,"The way it protects itself by flailing its arms may be an adorable sight, but stay well away. This is flailing that can snap thick tree trunks."
760,34,9,The moves it uses to take down its prey would make a martial artist jealous. It tucks subdued prey under its arms to carry them to its nest.
761,34,9,"When under attack, it secretes a sweet and delicious sweat. The scent only calls more enemies to it."
762,34,9,Any Corvisquire that pecks at this Pokémon will be greeted with a smack from its sepals followed by a sharp kick.
763,34,9,A kick from the hardened tips of this Pokémon’s legs leaves a wound in the opponent’s body and soul that will never heal.
764,34,9,"These Pokémon smell very nice. All Comfey wear different flowers, so each of these Pokémon has its own individual scent."
765,34,9,"It knows the forest inside and out. If it comes across a wounded Pokémon, Oranguru will gather medicinal herbs to treat it."
766,34,9,"Passimian live in groups of about 20, with each member performing an assigned role. Through cooperation, the group survives."
767,34,9,"Wimpod gather in swarms, constantly on the lookout for danger. They scatter the moment they detect an enemy’s presence."
768,34,9,"They live in sunken ships or in holes in the seabed. When Golisopod and Grapploct battle, the loser becomes the winner’s meal."
769,34,9,"Sandygast mainly inhabits beaches. It takes control of anyone who puts their hand into its mouth, forcing them to make its body bigger."
770,34,9,"This Pokémon lives on beaches, but it hates water. Palossand can’t maintain its castle-like shape if it gets drenched by a heavy rain."
771,34,9,"It’s covered in a slime that keeps its skin moist, allowing it to stay on land for days without drying up."
772,34,9,It was modeled after a mighty Pokémon of myth. The mask placed upon it limits its power in order to keep it under control.
773,34,9,The final factor needed to release this Pokémon’s true power was a strong bond with a Trainer it trusts.
776,34,9,Eating sulfur in its volcanic habitat is what causes explosive compounds to develop in its shell. Its droppings are also dangerously explosive.
777,34,9,"When it’s in trouble, it curls up into a ball, makes its fur spikes stand on end, and then discharges electricity indiscriminately."
778,34,9,There was a scientist who peeked under Mimikyu’s old rag in the name of research. The scientist died of a mysterious disease.
780,34,9,"Drampa is a kind and friendly Pokémon—up until it’s angered. When that happens, it stirs up a gale and flattens everything around."
781,34,9,"After lowering its anchor, it waits for its prey. It catches large Wailord and drains their life-force."
782,34,9,Jangmo-o strikes its scales to communicate with others of its kind. Its scales are actually fur that’s become as hard as metal.
783,34,9,"Before attacking its enemies, it clashes its scales together and roars. Its sharp claws shred the opposition."
784,34,9,Certain ruins have paintings of ancient warriors wearing armor made of Kommo-o scales.
789,34,9,"Cosmog is very curious but not very cautious, often placing itself in danger. If things start to look dicey, it teleports away."
790,34,9,"It sucks in dust from the air at an astounding rate, frantically building up energy within its core as preparation for evolution."
791,34,9,Solgaleo was once known as the Beast That Devours the Sun. Energy in the form of light radiates boundlessly from it.
792,34,9,"It steals the light from its surroundings and then becomes the full moon, showering its own light across the night sky."
800,34,9,"It needs light to survive, and it goes on a rampage seeking it out. Its laser beams will cut anything to pieces."
802,34,9,"This Pokémon can conceal itself in any shadow, so it went undiscovered for a long time."
807,34,9,"Electricity sparks from the pads on its limbs. Wherever Zeraora runs, lightning flashes and thunder echoes."
808,34,9,"They live as a group, but when the time comes, one strong Meltan will absorb all the others and evolve."
809,34,9,Centrifugal force is behind the punches of Melmetal’s heavy hex-nut arms. Melmetal is said to deliver the strongest punches of all Pokémon.
25,39,9,Possesses cheek sacs in which it stores electricity. This clever forest-dweller roasts tough berries with an electric shock before consuming them.
26,39,9,"It can discharge bursts of electricity exceeding 100,000 volts— a single strike with that amount of power would incapacitate one of the Copperajah of my homeland."
35,39,9,"It can be found in quiet mountain areas on a full moon's night. Its dancing and its tiny, faintly glowing wings confer upon it a lovely fairylike quality."
36,39,9,"Legend says that on clear, quiet nights, it listens for the voices of its kin living on the moon. I, too, often think of my homeland, so far away."
37,39,9,"In its belly burns a fire, which Vulpix spits out in the form of fireballs. When young, this Pokémon has but one white tail. As the Pokémon matures, this single tail splits into six."
38,39,9,The coat of gleaming golden fur is quite magnificent. This species is said to store sacred power in its nine long tails and to live for a millennium.
41,39,9,"Makes its home in gloomy caves. Atrophied eyes have left this Pokémon blind, so it scans its surroundings via sound waves that it emits from its mouth as it flies."
42,39,9,It sinks its sharp fangs into other creatures and slurps up their blood. A closer look at the fangs reveals that they are hollow and akin to straws.
46,39,9,Sometimes seen at the foot of trees in humid forests. The mushrooms on its back—called tochukaso—are not present on infant specimens and instead emerge as Paras matures.
47,39,9,"Mushroom-lacking specimens of this Pokémon lie unmoving in the forest, lending credence to the hypothesis that the large mushroom is in control of Parasect's actions."
54,39,9,"Suffers perpetual headaches. If the agony grows too great, Psyduck's latent power erupts, contrary to Psyduck's intent. Ergo, I am exploring ways to ease the pain."
55,39,9,"Its body is strong, and it has webbing on its hands and feet. Golduck can swim easily through rough seas, clawing its way through the high waves."
58,39,9,They patrol their territory in pairs. I believe the igneous rock components in the fur of this species are the result of volcanic activity in its habitat.
59,39,9,"Snaps at its foes with fangs cloaked in blazing flame. Despite its bulk, it deftly feints every which way, leading opponents on a deceptively merry chase as it all but dances around them."
63,39,9,"Spends 18 hours of the day sleeping. Even while asleep, Abra can control its psychic powers—should danger approach, the Pokémon will simply teleport away."
64,39,9,"There are rumors that a child with mystical powers became a Kadabra; however, this remains unverified. I suspect that the spoon Kadabra holds enhances its brain waves."
65,39,9,"The longer Alakazam lives, the larger and heavier its head becomes. Our tests have shown that the strength of its psychic powers correlates positively to the weight of its head."
66,39,9,"Though as small as a child, it has strength enough to easily throw a well-built adult. Striving to become ever stronger, Machop trains by carrying a Graveler on its shoulders."
67,39,9,A sturdy creature boasting a robust physique and boundless stamina. Loves training above all else and voluntarily assists with tasks such as construction and clearing land.
68,39,9,"In close combat, its four arms afford it offensive and defensive supremacy. In but a blink, this valiant Pokémon can overwhelm its foes with more than 1,000 blows from its fists."
72,39,9,"They fire beams from the glassy, magenta orbs that resemble eyes atop their heads, and they drift in shallow seas. During low tide, they can sometimes be found on beaches, desiccated."
73,39,9,"It has 80 tentacles, each with a venomous tip. These tentacles are also extendible, lengthening when Tentacruel attempts to catch prey. Use caution."
74,39,9,"Makes its home in mountainous regions, using its arms to climb along harsh mountain roads. Can be troublesome—carelessly kicking one will cause it to fly into a rage and chase after you."
75,39,9,"Dwells in holes dug into sheer walls of stone. It enjoys rolling down slopes as though it were a boulder during a rockfall, so keep an eye upward while traversing mountain roads."
76,39,9,"The rocklike shell is shed each year. The cast-off shell then crumbles, reverting to a mass of soil, which can be spread across fields to promote crop growth."
77,39,9,"These Pokémon live in herds out in the grassland. Newborn foals lack their fiery manes, which will develop about an hour after birth."
78,39,9,"Fiery mane aglow, Rapidash darts like an arrow across the land. This prodigiously swift creature can traverse the vast region of Hisui in a day and a half."
81,39,9,"A bizarre Pokémon with but a single eye embedded in an iron sphere. I suspect this creature levitates due to the magnetism it emits from its arms, which resemble horseshoe-shaped magnets."
82,39,9,"Three Magnemite gathered to evolve into this Pokémon. The source of much vexation on my part, as its powerful magnetism destroys my research equipment."
92,39,9,Gaseous and completely impalpable. Also highly dangerous— inhaling part of its poisonous body will cause one to faint instantly.
93,39,9,"This frightful, malevolent spirit can glide through walls, appearing wherever it likes. According to rumor, victims of a Haunter's lick will wither to death day by day."
94,39,9,"Possesses potential victims' shadows in an effort to steal away the victims' lives. If your shadow begins to laugh, you must take hold of a protective charm posthaste!"
95,39,9,"This chain of immense stones resembles a giant serpent. Tremors shake the earth above as it burrows deep beneath the ground, feeding on boulders as it goes."
100,39,9,"An enigmatic Pokémon that happens to bear a resemblance to a Poké Ball. When excited, it discharges the electric current it has stored in its belly, then lets out a great, uproarious laugh."
101,39,9,"The tissue on the surface of its body is curiously similar in composition to an Apricorn. When irritated, this Pokémon lets loose an electric current equal to 20 lightning bolts."
108,39,9,"Wields its long tongue deftly, as though it were an arm. The Pokémon's viscous saliva, once it has been collected and boiled down, yields a strong and highly useful adhesive."
111,39,9,"Ludicrously strong—when it butts heads with a mountain, it is the mountain that shatters. But its short legs struggle with turns, and it is incapable of stopping unless it collides with something."
112,39,9,"Rapidly rotates its horn to bore through bedrock. It swaggers around volcanic regions, protected from the lava's heat by its tough, armorlike hide."
113,39,9,This purehearted Pokémon shares its eggs with the injured.
114,39,9,"It is cloaked entirely in blue vines, preventing any glimpse of its true identity. The vines impart a refreshing sensation when chewed—they're useful as a spice."
122,39,9,The behavior of this clown-like Pokémon reminds one of pantomime. It creates invisible walls using a force emitted from its fingertips.
123,39,9,"The large, wickedly sharp scythes on its forearms are truly fearsome weapons. Prey's attempts to flee are unfailingly thwarted by this Pokémon's nimble motions."
125,39,9,"Feeds on electrical energy. During sudden showers beneath looming thunderclouds, one can observe Electabuzz scaling tall trees, where the Pokémon will then wait for lightning to strike."
126,39,9,"Legend has it that this Pokémon was born from the crater of a volcano. When wounded, it bathes in lava to heal its body, much as one would soak in a hot spring."
129,39,9,"A feeble, pitiful imbecile of a Pokémon that is nonetheless very hardy. Unperturbed by turbid water, it can be found living in all sorts of places."
130,39,9,"I suspect this Pokémon to be the true identity of a dragon written of in ancient texts, which claimed that it razed an entire village with white-hot beams from its maw."
133,39,9,Harbors the potential to evolve into manifold forms. Within Eevee lies the key to the mysteries of Pokémon evolution—I'm certain of it.
134,39,9,"Tests show that its cells closely resemble water molecules, which perhaps explains its ability to conceal its form while submerged. I believe the origins of mermaid folklore lie with this Pokémon."
135,39,9,"Bristles its fur into sharp, needlelike points when enraged. One can hear electricity crackle in its breath when it exhales."
136,39,9,"Flames burn within a saclike organ inside this Pokémon. When Flareon inhales, these flames grow in intensity, reaching a mighty 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit."
137,39,9,"It has no discernible heartbeat and does not seem to draw breath, and yet it appears to function without issue. I cannot even begin to explain this utterly bizarre anomaly."
143,39,9,This glutton appears in villages without warning and devours the entirety of their rice granaries—such occurrences have long been counted among the gravest of disasters.
155,39,9,"Hails from the Johto region. Though usually curled into a ball due to its timid disposition, it harbors tremendous firepower."
156,39,9,"This creature's fur is most mysterious—it is wholly impervious to the burning touch of flame. Should Quilava turn its back to you, take heed! Such a posture indicates a forthcoming attack."
157,39,9,"Said to purify lost, forsaken souls with its flames and guide them to the afterlife. I believe its form has been influenced by the energy of the sacred mountain towering at Hisui's center."
169,39,9,Its hind limbs have become another set of wings. Crobat expertly maneuvers its four wings to dart in exquisite fashion through even the most confined caves without losing any speed.
172,39,9,"Pichu stores electricity in the sacs on its cheeks but discharges it inadvertently when agitated or excited. Being yet immature, the Pokémon's handling of electricity is rather inept."
173,39,9,"In silhouette, they resemble twinkling starlight. When shooting stars rain from the night sky, Cleffa gather in numbers and dance as though they are indeed incarnations of the stars."
175,39,9,This ovate creature is frequently mistaken for a moving egg when encountered out in the fields or in the mountains. Its guileless smile soothes the soul.
176,39,9,"No records exist of Togetic being seen in the wilds. Rumors abound that it evolves under the loving care of a trusted human companion, upon whom the Pokémon then bestows great joy."
185,39,9,"Though it pretends to be a tree, it fails to fool even children. To the touch, its body feels more like rock than tree bark. Sudowoodo's extreme aversion to water merits special note."
190,39,9,This treetop dweller possesses a tail as dexterous as a hand. Ancient writings describe this Pokémon as a one-armed oddity.
193,39,9,"Its frail wings are so thin that one can see clear through them. However, during flight these wings exhibit the power to churn air with force enough to launch a house skyward."
196,39,9,"Wields an arcane power with which it can predict the weather and even people's thoughts. When bathed in sunshine, the scarlet orb on its brow glows and builds energy."
197,39,9,"It is most active in the wee hours of the night, when moonlight bathes the land. Its large eyes can pierce the darkness and perceive prey with absolute clarity."
198,39,9,"Widely shunned as a bearer of ill fortune. Upon crossing paths with this creature, I've been told one must chant ”Workrum, Workrum—bad luck, don't come” as a protective incantation."
200,39,9,"It conceals itself in darkness, sending chills up travelers' spines with its childlike weeping. As it observes the frightened travelers with glee, the red orbs upon its chest let off an eerie light."
201,39,9,It is hard to believe these strangely shaped Pokémon are truly living creatures. I've pointed out that the species' many forms resemble writing from other lands; no one will take me seriously.
207,39,9,"Its tail is tipped by a thick, horrible stinger. To bring down prey, it will first obscure their vision by covering their faces with its body, and then it will use the stinger to inject them with venom."
208,39,9,This Pokémon evolved through use of a strange item. Its body is coated with steel powder and notably hard—not even diamond can leave so much as a scratch.
211,39,9,"Fishers detest this troublesome Pokémon because it sprays poison from its spines, getting it everywhere. A different form of Qwilfish lives in other regions."
212,39,9,Evolved by way of a curious item. The shell covering its body has been shown to be stronger than forged steel.
214,39,9,This Pokémon has an unparalleled horn. Heracross itself demonstrates tremendous power—it's capable of throwing several people trained in the traditional arts of war at once.
215,39,9,"Its sturdy, curved claws are ideal for traversing precipitous cliffs. From the tips of these claws drips a venom that infiltrates the nerves of any prey caught in Sneasel's grasp."
216,39,9,"It licks its paws because of the sweet honey that has soaked into them. It is cunning, stealing into the nests of Combee and taking for itself the honey that the Combee have amassed."
217,39,9,"When the cold season arrives in Hisui, this Pokémon will wander fields and mountains alike in search of its favorite berries. Ursaring's hunger during this time makes it a ferocious danger."
220,39,9,"Swinub excels at sniffing out mushrooms buried beneath grass or snow. Since ancient times, the people of Hisui have often relied upon this skill."
221,39,9,"The long fur of this Pokémon covers its eyes, ears, and even limbs, allowing Piloswine to resist harshly frigid conditions. The Pokémon's white tusks can be used to defeat its enemies."
223,39,9,Spits water from its mouth with incredible accuracy. It captures Burmy by shooting them down off the branches from which they dangle.
224,39,9,"While Octillery still shoots water from its mouth, the drastic anatomical difference between it and Remoraid meant that for a long time, no one believed the former evolved from the latter."
226,39,9,"This calm and gentle Pokémon swims gracefully through the sea. After building speed, it can leap out of the water. It is often misidentified as a bird Pokémon due to this behavior."
233,39,9,"A bizarre item caused this Pokémon to evolve. While it now exhibits many new gestures and expressions, its biology remains inscrutable."
234,39,9,Its strangely shaped antlers have the power to bewitch those who see them. Medicine made by grinding up the black orbs from fallen antlers is an effective treatment for insomnia.
239,39,9,"They generate electricity by spinning their arms. During a thunderstorm, if one hears the lively voices of children out in the wilderness, what one is actually hearing are the voices of Elekid."
240,39,9,"This Pokémon lives in volcanic areas. With each breath, sparks spurt from its mouth and nose. When Magby is in good health, its flames gain a yellow tint."
242,39,9,A kindhearted Pokémon that will care for any sick person or Pokémon until their health improves. The eggs it lays are delicious and bring good fortune to those who eat them.
265,39,9,Likes sap and is abundant in the wild. Why it evolves into various different forms is unknown. One cannot tell from a Wurmple's appearance which form it will take when it evolves.
266,39,9,"Wraps itself in thin strings of silk while it stores energy for evolution. It can't extend its limbs and its movement is slow, but its eyes keep a sharp lookout—Silcoon is always on guard."
267,39,9,"A colorful and incredibly beautiful but also greedy Pokémon. In an effort to keep its favorite food all to itself, it will chase away Combee as they try to gather nectar."
268,39,9,"The silk coating its body is thin but sufficiently strong. Cascoon's silk has a luster and texture superior to that of Silcoon's, and clothes made using Cascoon silk are regarded as top-notch."
269,39,9,Tends to be drawn to bonfires on dark nights. Difficult to chase away from settlements because of the way it scatters highly toxic scales.
280,39,9,"Tends to prefer people with a chipper disposition to those who are gloomy, but it has shown no discrimination with regard to age or gender. Needs more research."
281,39,9,"It resembles a maiden in appearance, but it wields strange powers to project visions of paradise. I suspect the crimson ornaments on its head are the key to its abilities."
282,39,9,"It will dedicate itself to defending a master it has come to adore. Its pure white dress, reminiscent of those worn by ladies of nobility, is the dress of one who is willing to risk their life."
299,39,9,"Once the people of Hisui discovered that its red nose always points north, they grew to rely on it greatly when traveling afar. The nose seems to work in a similar way to ancient compasses."
315,39,9,"Though beautiful, it has highly poisonous thorns. There is an old tradition in my homeland wherein one would send these thorns to an opponent to challenge them to a duel."
339,39,9,"Makes its home in swamps with murky water. The poor visibility hides this Pokémon from predators, and the slime on its body makes grasping it difficult."
340,39,9,Strikes its caudal fin against the swamp bed to shake the ground and startle its prey. It will then swallow the fleeing prey whole. People mistook this behavior as the cause of earthquakes.
355,39,9,I've heard that the children of Hisui all begin to behave once they've been told the story of how this Pokémon roams about before the witching hour to spirit away misbehaving children.
356,39,9,"There are rumors that peeking inside its bandage-wrapped body will cause one to get pulled in through the gaps between the bandages, never to return. I've been too scared to verify."
358,39,9,Can emit waves of air powerful enough to knock out prey taller than itself. I hypothesize that it amplifies the faint sound of wind within its body.
361,39,9,"Arrives alongside the first snow. It's thought that homes Snorunt visit will prosper for many generations. By tradition, one might offer a lump of ice made from pure water at one's front door."
362,39,9,"It covers its body with an armor of ice harder than steel. Uses its breath to freeze prey, which it then devours as if they were frozen desserts."
363,39,9,"During the season when drift ice approaches the shore, Spheal prefers living on the ice—where fewer predators lurk—rather than the land. Its fur retains heat superbly and resists harsh cold."
364,39,9,"Its white whiskers are very sensitive. Sealeo will balance Spheal on the tip of its nose, checking its scent and its feel to be sure the Spheal is healthy."
365,39,9,"Its thick tusks are strong enough to shatter drift ice. They have been known to break, but they will grow back by the next year. The Hisui region is well known for these broken tusks."
387,39,9,This Pokémon becomes more energetic the more sunlight there is. The part resembling a shell is similar to silt and is slightly damp and warm to the touch.
388,39,9,"Appears where there is clean spring water. The fruit that grows on the shrubs on its shell is sweet, nutritious, and truly delicious."
389,39,9,"This remarkable, large-bodied Pokémon would serve beautifully as borrowed scenery for a garden, and its strength is peerless. Torterra roams the wilderness in search of clean water."
390,39,9,Full of vigor and always in high spirits. It was once known by the name ”Lantern-Tail” and feared as some kind of apparition.
391,39,9,"The deeper the blue on its face, the more powerful it will grow to become. It leaps about every which way and lands powerful blows against its opponents with the flame on its tail."
392,39,9,"A tall, hardy Pokémon with a dazzling appearance. It shrouds itself in flame and battles as if engaged in dance—truly a sight to behold."
393,39,9,"Prefers cold climes and appears along coasts. It's an adorable little thing—as cute as any child—but it's also prideful, unwilling to accept handouts from people."
394,39,9,"It swims gracefully through the frigid sea and sings with a voice like the roaring tide. It has powerful, sturdy wings and dignity to match."
395,39,9,"Since ancient times, it has been revered by the people of Hisui, who call it the Master of the Waves. Its wings are a match for even master-crafted blades."
396,39,9,"They live in the fields and mountains, gathering in large flocks. Their cries are quite obnoxious. Though small, their wings are strong—a strike from them leaves pain that persists for a week."
397,39,9,They form remarkably large flocks and are constantly fighting amongst themselves. I suspect that those with magnificent plumes on their heads are the strong ones.
398,39,9,"It has left the flock, having gained strength enough to survive on its own. The astounding force with which Staraptor flies through the air allows it to carry away large, burly targets."
399,39,9,Bidoof has an unsophisticated face and is rarely flustered by anything. There have been incidents involving Bidoof sauntering into villages and gnawing on the houses without a single care.
400,39,9,Bibarel fur repels water and is also a fantastic material for heat retention. These Pokémon create dams on rivers to live in.
401,39,9,"When the trees take on new hues, more of these Pokémon appear. The tone they create by striking their antennae together resembles that of the marimba, an instrument of foreign lands."
402,39,9,"It uses its cutlass-like arms to produce sound, the melody of which varies from individual to individual. It is a worthwhile endeavor to seek out one's favorite tunes."
403,39,9,Shakes its body to generate electricity. Its stature belies its aggression—one must be patient to tame this Pokémon.
404,39,9,"Proudly uses its electrified claws as weapons. It seems to be a gracious Pokémon, evenly sharing the spoils of the hunt with others of its kind."
405,39,9,"They form packs, each having one male as leader. Legends say that when Luxray's two eyes shimmer with gold, the Pokémon can see through anything."
406,39,9,"When the sun's light strengthens, the bud atop this Pokémon's head opens. This is a sign to the people that the harsh winter is over, and the season of budding has begun."
407,39,9,Hidden within the bouquet on each hand are thorned whips loaded with virulent poison. Roserade moves gracefully as it corners its prey and mercilessly lashes them with its whips.
408,39,9,"An incredibly rare sight. They duel each other by ramming their heads together, and the resulting sound echoes throughout the area like the pealing of a bell."
409,39,9,"Very little is known about its biology. Can knock down massive trees by smashing its beautiful, pearl-like crown against them."
410,39,9,"Much remains unknown about this Pokémon, as few have ever seen it. However, we know that it is calm and dislikes conflict, and it enjoys polishing its face against trees and rocks."
411,39,9,"Its face is sturdy—as strong as diamond—and this hardness offers a very stable defense. Much about this species is still unknown, such as its natural habitat."
412,39,9,"If its cloak is even slightly damaged, Burmy will immediately repair it with whatever is close at hand. The Pokémon within the cloak is scrawny and vulnerable to the cold."
414,39,9,"Scatters steel-colored scales as it flaps its wings. Despite being observed feeding primarily on the nectar of flowers, Mothim is not often seen around flower gardens."
415,39,9,They swear fealty to a queen Pokémon and work diligently to gather nectar. Each swarm produces a different flavor of honey.
416,39,9,Commands its subjects to build its hive. It will dispatch any interlopers who dare sneak into its nest and use them as nourishment for itself.
417,39,9,"A species related to the Pikachu line. Though Pachirisu is a calm Pokémon, it still presents a danger should one touch its electrified tail or cheeks."
418,39,9,It moves freely in the water by spinning its forked tail for propulsion. The resemblance to the screw of a steamboat is coincidental.
419,39,9,"Has a long, rather splendid flotation sac, which prevents Floatzel from drowning even in stormy seas. One might glimpse this species around fishing hamlets from time to time."
420,39,9,"Once the fruit growing alongside the main body is large and plump, Cherubi will use the nutrients within to evolve. The fruit then detaches, becoming nourishment for other creatures."
421,39,9,"Motionless, save for the occasional quiver. A rich array of Pokémon can be found gathered around it, drawn by the scent exuded from Cherrim's folded petals."
422,39,9,Found in abundance on seashores bordering warm waters. Shellos are unexpectedly friendly and will crawl toward any person they see. Take care not to get coated in mucus!
423,39,9,"Eats beach sand for nourishment. Should one Gastrodon encounter another of a different color, a fierce battle will inevitably ensue."
424,39,9,"To affirm their kinship, members of this species will form a ring by linking their newly doubled tails together. On rare occasions, humans have been accepted into such rings."
425,39,9,"Said to lure away young children and carry them off to the afterlife. Some whisper that Drifloon are formed of reincarnated human souls, but these rumors are as yet unconfirmed."
426,39,9,"It drifts along at dusk, perfectly silent. Its transient, melancholy aspect touches some people deeply—every so often, one will come upon a song or poem devoted to Drifblim."
427,39,9,My hypothesis as to why Buneary rolls up its ears is that its hearing is far too keen. I surmise that the Pokémon protects its hearing by limiting the sound that may enter its ears.
428,39,9,"Its fur is warm and yet remarkably light. This Pokémon kicks as though it were a master of karate, driving back its opponents with ease."
429,39,9,"The incantations Mismagius chants can ward against misfortune, so a custom exists of inviting it into one's home. Incur the Pokémon's displeasure, however, and disaster will surely ensue."
430,39,9,"One cry from this Pokémon, and a murder of Murkrow come flying. At such times, one would think the curtain of night had fallen, plunging the world into jet-black darkness."
431,39,9,"Bewitches humans with its helical tail and piercing gaze. Its hidden claws are quite sharp as well, making this Pokémon an exceedingly tricky opponent if antagonized."
432,39,9,"Though impudent and difficult to tame, Purugly enjoys great popularity due to its fur, the beauty of which surpasses even velveteen."
433,39,9,This Pokémon gave me an excruciating headache when it seemingly cried out without making a sound. Perhaps there are some sounds that the human ear is simply incapable of hearing.
434,39,9,The poison that gushes from its aft end is accompanied by an utterly evil-smelling odor with such potency that one whiff can induce memory loss.
435,39,9,"Sprays a poisonous fluid to take down prey. Sometimes, unable to stomach the stench of its own fluid, it leaves the bested prey uneaten."
436,39,9,Floats using a mysterious energy. The pattern engraved upon its back is held as sacred and can sometimes be found in imagery from ancient cemeteries and other such timeworn places.
437,39,9,Some believe that its bell-like cry opens holes to another world. It has been revered as a deity since ancient times.
438,39,9,"Its tears elicit sympathy from those who see them, but do not be deceived! This expulsion of body water is merely a physiological mechanism for keeping itself in good health."
439,39,9,"Known to turn up in bustling marketplaces now and again. It mimics people much as a child would, then watches how they react, eyes sparkling."
440,39,9,"In imitation of Chansey, it keeps a round stone tucked into its belly pouch and cherishes it dearly. It gets along well with children and will sometimes play house with them for fun."
441,39,9,"A versatile performer skilled in the imitation of human speech. It is said that older, more experienced Chatot can even understand the meaning of the words they mimic."
442,39,9,It lays curses by thinking wicked thoughts. Writings tell that this Pokémon was born out of the assembly of five score and eight malevolent spirits.
443,39,9,"It nests in caves untouched by sunlight. Its sharp teeth may fall out when worn away or after an impact, but they regrow within a few days."
444,39,9,"Though Gabite are usually of a violent disposition, when I gave one a glass bead it had been eyeing covetously, it suddenly became quite docile."
445,39,9,Soars across the heavens at blinding speed—a magnificent sight! It has a feral disposition. Utmost caution is required if one meets a Garchomp out in the wilds.
446,39,9,"Its robust stomach allows it to nonchalantly devour even rotted matter. It pays frequent visits to villages, seeking out food scraps intended for compost."
447,39,9,"Though infantile in appearance, it has the mysterious ability to read the minds of humans. The pure of heart are met with Riolu's approval, while those of ill nature earn only its loathing."
448,39,9,"A most gallant-looking creature. It emits energy waves and controls them with precision, using them to sense even faraway beings. I have given the name ”aura” to this power."
449,39,9,"Though large and languid, Hippopotas is difficult to detect due to its tendency to burrow into and lurk beneath the soil. When agitated or excited, it expels sand from its nostrils."
450,39,9,"Short-tempered and easily moved to violence. It whips up whirlwinds of sand to crush its foes' spirits, then goes in for the attack."
451,39,9,"Its claws are not only razor-sharp but poisonous, making Skorupi a highly dangerous Pokémon. It seems to be weakened by cold temperatures, however."
452,39,9,"Has a brutish, ferocious temperament. With immense strength and a sturdy shell off which swords will bounce, it rampages about and wreaks havoc."
453,39,9,"A poison wielder with a dastardly personality. Despite such qualities, this species is afforded a measure of popularity due to its peculiar cry and comical features."
454,39,9,"Its crimson claws contain a virulent toxin. This toxin can be made into a tonic by diluting it, mixing it with several types of wild grass, and boiling it down over two days."
455,39,9,"Though this is a plant Pokémon, it has a gluttonous and unruly temperament. Carnivine attacks its prey with its cavernous maw wide open."
456,39,9,"What a gorgeous sight this Pokémon is as it swims with its long, pink-painted caudal fins fluttering behind it. Finneon's beautiful appearance has led to its nickname: ”finery fish.”"
457,39,9,Uses its gleaming fins to hunt its prey. The view of Lumineon schooling near the surface of the sea at night is breathtaking— it's as though there were shining stars right there.
458,39,9,"Though ball-like in shape, this Pokémon is a proficient swimmer. I have discovered that if a Mantyke spends much time with schools of Remoraid, it will eventually achieve evolution."
459,39,9,"One is likely to encounter this Pokémon while out in the snow. There are stories of Snover appearing in human settlements but doing no harm—rather, they bond with the children."
460,39,9,"A powerful Pokémon that can split huge boulders with ease. Dislikes associating with others and chooses to live quietly deep within the mountains, playing with the snow."
461,39,9,"This species corners prey as a pack, under the guidance of a leader. Weavile displays increased cunning, leading me to speculate that its evolution caused further brain development."
462,39,9,"I theorize that a special magnetic field influenced this Pokémon, changing its molecular structure and causing it to evolve. It emits strange radio waves toward space from its antenna."
463,39,9,"Its tongue can extend and contract freely, and it is capable of reaching lengths over 10 times Lickilicky's height. Beware of the saliva, as it contains corrosive elements."
464,39,9,This Pokémon evolved through use of a curious item. Its rocklike hide is composed of a mysterious substance and can withstand a blow from a masterwork sword with nary a scratch.
465,39,9,"Draped with long vines, it resembles a shrub in appearance. It swings bundles of vines as though they were arms, wrapping them around prey to ensnare them."
466,39,9,"Its evolution was induced by an unusual item, and its electrical output rises along with its heart rate. From its tails, it can unleash an electric current measuring 20,000 volts."
467,39,9,Use of a strange item caused this Pokémon to evolve. Fireballs launched from the ends of its tubelike arms are hot enough to melt an iron pot in an instant.
468,39,9,"Scant few have ever sighted this Pokémon. After studying what literature remains, I am certain Togekiss will reveal itself when peace reigns in the land."
469,39,9,"Extremely violent. When hunting, it wastes none of its energy, aiming only for prey's most vulnerable spots. Any who manage to tame this Pokémon must be of incredible bravery."
470,39,9,"Cells similar to those of plants have been found in its fur. Its hard tail can fell a large tree with one stroke, and the tail's sharpness exceeds even that of a sword crafted by a master."
471,39,9,"Glaceon is able to lower its body temperature very quickly. It freezes the atmosphere, creating diamond dust that glitters like gems while it flutters and dances around."
472,39,9,It glides soundlessly on pitch-black wings and sinks sharp fangs into the throat of its prey. It takes on a look of satisfaction once it has entirely drained its prey of blood.
473,39,9,"This species reached its zenith during the period known as the ice age. I suspect that Hisui's frigid climate is in harmony with Mamoswine's constitution, thus awakening hidden potential."
474,39,9,"A curious item induced this evolution. The Pokémon's offensive capabilities have greatly increased, but the strangeness of its behavior has magnified in equal measure. This worries me."
475,39,9,"The blades extending from its elbows are sharper than the finest swords. Its swordsmanship, albeit self-taught, is astonishingly impressive."
476,39,9,"It is able to emit powerful magnetism, allowing it control over the iron sand that forms its luscious mustache. Using this iron sand, Probopass forms hard stones with which it smites its prey."
477,39,9,"Comes to those whose lives have come to an end and escorts their souls to the afterlife. Known to mistakenly take the souls of those who yet have life left in them, albeit rarely."
478,39,9,A Pokémon inhabited by the soul of a woman who died bearing a grudge in the snowy mountains. Legends of Froslass placing deathly curses on misbehaving men send shivers down my spine.
479,39,9,"This bizarre Pokémon appears to be a will-o'-the-wisp powered by electricity. Be wary, as Rotom is both smart and mischievous."
480,39,9,A Pokémon feared but also respected for stealing away the memories of evildoers. I have found records that suggest Uxie holds dominion over knowledge.
481,39,9,"Known as the Being of Emotion. In legend, this Pokémon was feared, as any who showed disrespect would have their emotions thrown into disarray."
482,39,9,The dreaded Being of Willpower. Legends tell of this Pokémon manipulating the will of its adversaries and turning them into puppets of its own.
483,39,9,This Pokémon is revered as a deity in Hisuian legend. The birth of Dialga was what caused the vast river of time to begin flowing in our world.
484,39,9,"This Pokémon is feared as a deity in Hisuian legend. The birth of Palkia was what caused the walls of our world to disappear, creating a sky that spans for infinity."
485,39,9,Stories tell of this Pokémon being birthed from the boiling magma within Mount Coronet. Its molten-steel body holds many mysteries.
486,39,9,"According to legend, Regigigas pulled landmasses together and bound them with rope to create the continent of Hisui. Though I have my doubts, the story could well contain a shred of truth."
487,39,9,There is one Hisuian verse that tells of a powerful light creating a deep shadow. I imagine that this deep shadow is Giratina.
488,39,9,Cresselia is reminiscent of the crescent moon. It leaves a brilliant line of light in its wake as it flies across the night sky. I daresay it resembles the heavenly maiden who created the Milky Way.
489,39,9,Can be seen floating offshore during seasons when the seas are warm. Its azure body blends in with the ocean waters—logic suggests this is a defense mechanism against natural predators.
490,39,9,"Rumored to migrate across the oceans and visit Hisui's coastal waters only rarely. Although Manaphy resembles Phione, it is also quite different. The relation between the two is unclear."
491,39,9,"On a moonless night, a strange incident occurred in which every one of a village's inhabitants suffered nightmares. The villagers attested that Darkrai appeared before them in these nightmares."
492,39,9,"When the turning of seasons brings the cruel winter to its end and the joyous people give thanks to the heavens, Shaymin appears and covers the withered land with flowers."
493,39,9,It is the heavenly fount from which pours the light that shines across Hisui. Its luminance guides and protects all Pokémon. Hisuian mythology states that Arceus is the creator of all things.
501,39,9,"This Pokémon from the Unova region uses the shell on its belly as a weapon to cut down its foes. Thus, I've conferred upon this shell the name ”scalchop”."
502,39,9,"Its exquisite double-scalchop technique is likely the result of daily training, and it can send even masters of the blade fleeing in defeat."
503,39,9,"Hard of heart and deft of blade, this rare form of Samurott is a product of the Pokémon's evolution in the region of Hisui. Its turbulent blows crash into foes like ceaseless pounding waves."
548,39,9,"The leaves on its head are highly valued for medicinal purposes. Dry the leaves in the sun, boil them, and then drink the bitter decoction for remarkably effective relief from fatigue."
549,39,9,I suspect that its well-developed legs are the result of a life spent on mountains covered in deep snow. The scent it exudes from its flower crown heartens those in proximity.
550,39,9,"Though it differs from other Basculin in several respects, including demeanor—this one is gentle—I have categorized it as a regional form given the vast array of shared qualities."
570,39,9,"A once-departed soul, returned to life in Hisui. Derives power from resentment, which rises as energy atop its head and takes on the forms of foes. In this way, Zorua vents lingering malice."
571,39,9,"With its disheveled white fur, it looks like an embodiment of death. Heedless of its own safety, Zoroark attacks its nemeses with a bitter energy so intense, it lacerates Zoroark's own body."
627,39,9,"Its chick-like looks belie its hotheadedness. It challenges its parents at every opportunity, desperate to prove its strength."
628,39,9,"Screaming a bloodcurdling battle cry, this huge and ferocious bird Pokémon goes out on the hunt. It blasts lakes with shock waves, then scoops up any prey that float to the water's surface."
641,39,9,This storm-stirring Pokémon is said to cause the seasons to turn by whipping up the air. I suspect its humanlike form to be a false one.
642,39,9,"They say this wielder of electricity has waged war with its nemesis, Tornadus, since time immemorial. The lightning bolts it hurls pierce the very earth and enrich the soil."
645,39,9,"When the incarnations of wind and of lightning clash, Landorus arrives to quell the conflict. After the tempests and thunderbolts abate, the land is sure to be blessed with bountiful harvests."
700,39,9,It emits a soothing aura from its ribbon-shaped organs. It wraps these appendages around quarrelers to instantly restore calm to the situation.
704,39,9,"Goomy hides away in the shade of trees, where it's nice and humid. If the slime coating its body dries out, the Pokémon instantly becomes lethargic."
705,39,9,A creature given to melancholy. I suspect its metallic shell developed as a result of the mucus on its skin reacting with the iron in Hisui's water.
706,39,9,Able to freely control the hardness of its metallic shell. It loathes solitude and is extremely clingy—it will fume and run riot if those dearest to it ever leave its side.
712,39,9,Lives on mountains blanketed in perennial snow. It freezes water vapor in the air to make the ice helmet that it dons for defense.
713,39,9,"The armor of ice covering its lower jaw puts steel to shame and can shatter rocks with ease. This Pokémon barrels along steep mountain paths, cleaving through the deep snow."
722,39,9,Flies noiselessly on delicate wings. It has mastered the art of deftly launching dagger-sharp feathers from those same wings.
723,39,9,"Regularly basks in sunlight to gather power—presumably due to the frigid climate. Nonetheless, the edges of the blade quills set into its wings are keen as ever."
724,39,9,The air stored inside the rachises of Decidueye's feathers insulates the Pokémon against Hisui's extreme cold. This is firm proof that evolution can be influenced by environment.
