To create a Collapse, use the HTML tag `details`, then `p`, then `/p`, then `/details`, between LessThan and GreaterThan signs. To add a Label to the collapse, add the HTML tags `summary` and `/summary` on the right of the `details` HTML tag.

To create a link, put the name of the link between square parentheses, then put the link itself between round parentheses, with no spaces.

[This is a link to a local Markdown page.](./index.md)

[This is a link to another webpage.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

[You can link files too. If the file can't display on a browser window, a download will start.](https://static.f-list.net/images/avatar/tokumei%20kii.png)

Add ! at the beginning before the square parenthesis to embed. You cannot embed links or webpages, only files. There's no need to put anything inside the square parenthesis when you're embedding.

This is a smol PNG one line below.

You can make footnotes with a caret and a number, between square brackets[^1].
You can also use whatever name you want instead of a number.[^Name]

[^1]: Add a colon (NOT semicolon) to invoke the footnote, make sure it's at the bottom of the page and at the beginning of the line.
[^Name]: Although it will still display as a number with certain themes.
