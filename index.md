Hi, I am Miles Farber. This is a very, very unfinished website that acts as a Nexus for Bound By Heart: Pokémon Mystery Dungeon.
{: .fs-10 }
Everything you see here is [AGPLv.3.0](https://github.com/MilesFarber/Pokemon-Mystery-Dungeon-Nexus/blob/Leader/LICENSE), and can be used by ANYONE. If you are making your own Generation 7 Pokémon Mystery Dungeon project, and you need some data, you can use this repository (or everything else in my Github account) as a template.
{: .fs-10 }
You can choose to only use parts of it. For example, you can use the Pokédex portion, but also decide to not use the Characters portion (recommended) since they are Originael Charectors Donut Steel, and are only meant to be used if you are too lazy to make your own characters for your project, or if you need a starting point.
{: .fs-10 }
This repository does not include any content from Generation 8 or above. I had to stop at Generation 7 because if I didn't this project would never be finished and I would die from fatigue and there are too many plot holes and retcons and aaaaaaaaaaaa. Purease understandu.

If there are any issues contact me on [Discord @MilesFarber](https://discord.com/users/207815740399681538) or [Github @MilesFarber](https://github.com/MilesFarber). You are also 100% free to fork this if I get assassinated as long as you agree to [AGPLv.3.0](https://github.com/MilesFarber/Pokemon-Mystery-Dungeon-Nexus/blob/Leader/LICENSE).
