IQ,Group,Name,Target,Description,Notes
0,-,Course Checker,Partner Pokémon,"If this Pokémon has a foe targeted for a move or a thrown item, it will check first for walls and other Pokémon that may get in the way. It will stop if there is an obstacle.","In the case of linked moves, Course Checker will only check the first one. So if the combination is Growl+Razor Leaf, the Razor Leaf could still be wasted as it has more terrain limitations than Growl."
0,"A,B,D",Dedicated Traveler,Partner Pokémon,The Pokémon will focus on traveling. It will use moves and items less often.,"As long as moving is an option, the partner will do so and not stop to attack any nearby Pokémon."
0,-,Escapist,All Pokémon,"The Pokémon has the power to let rescue targets escape a dungeon. This is an essential IQ Skill for exploration teams. Team members must always be ready to use this skill, so it can't be turned off.",
0,-,Exclusive Move-User,Partner Pokémon,"The Pokémon only uses moves, not its regular attack. It won't use moves that are out of PP or moves with a link that will delink if used one more time.","This can be used in conjunction with the move menu to get the partner to use a particular attack, or to simply do nothing."
0,-,Item Catcher,All Pokémon,"The Pokémon can catch and hold a thrown item, unless it is already holding an item. It can't catch seeds or health drinks.","Projectiles like Gravelerocks or Iron Thorns can be caught by team members, but not by enemies."
0,-,Item Master,Partner Pokémon,The Pokémon will use or throw its hold item.,This skill must be turned on for the Pokémon to use Reviver and Reviser Seeds. It does not prevent the Pokémon from using Natural Gift with a held Seed or Berry.
5,G,PP Checker,Partner Pokémon,The Pokémon will stop using linked moves that are on the verge of delinking. It also stops using moves with no PP left.,"As it is possible to stop partners using a particular move, this can safely be switched with Exclusive Move-User when required. This skill doesn't take Pressure into account, resulting in linked moves still becoming delinked when one move has 2 PP remaining."
10,"E,H",Efficiency Expert,Partner Pokémon,"When near several enemies, the Pokémon will target the one that has the lowest HP.","Checks the enemy's HP number, rather than percentage of HP remaining."
25,-,Status Checker,Partner Pokémon,The Pokémon will not use moves that cause a status problem if the target already has the same status problem.,"If Exclusive Move-User is on (and Weak-Type Picker is off), a Pokémon will ""watch carefully"" and do nothing if its move choice is stopped by Status Checker. This skill also stops the Pokémon from using healing moves unless an ally has a status condition or is at critical HP."
30,"B,E",Cheerleader,Partner Pokémon,"The Pokémon cheers on nearby team members, boosting their Attack and Special Attack by 1 level.","Works for adjacent allies.

65,"B,E,H",Bodyguard,All Pokémon,"If a team member next to this Pokémon is in trouble and has low HP, the Pokémon will step in to take attacks aimed at the friend.","Works for allies below 25% HP when an attack is used. Only works against single-target attacks. If an ally falls below 25% HP during a move with multiple hits, a Pokémon with Bodyguard will take the remaining attacks. The skill will not activate if the Pokémon with Bodyguard is affected by certain status conditions."

125,"F,J",Weak-Type Picker,Partner Pokémon,"When near several enemies, the Pokémon will target the one that has a type disadvantage.","Causes allies to consider all of its moves when deciding on what to do, rather than only a single move at random per turn and the regular attack."

Pokémon that step into tiles they cannot normally enter (such as water or lava) will warp randomly."

Its evasion is reduced by 1 level, however.","All moves with 5 accuracy stars (and some moves with 4 accuracy stars, along with Blizzard) will no longer miss under normal conditions. Overrides the accuracy bonus granted to female Pokémon. No Guard's effect prevents this skill from working, even for the user."

This affects the power of moves that the Pokémon uses, as well as the power of moves that hit the Pokémon!","Multipliers for super-effective/not very effective/ineffective damage change from 140%/70%/50% to 170%/50%/25%, respectively. Skill can be turned off to lessen the negative impacts of a type disadvantage, unless the enemy also has Erratic Player."
